# The Rust Programming Language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rust-lang/book.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rust-lang/book)

This repository contains the source of "The Rust Programming Language" book.

[The book is available in dead-tree form from No Starch Press][nostarch]

[nostarch]: https://nostarch.com/rust

You can also read the book for free online. Please see the book as shipped with
the latest [stable], [beta], or [nightly] Rust releases. Be aware that issues
in those versions may have been fixed in this repository already, as those
releases are updated less frequently.

[stable]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
[beta]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/
[nightly]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook], ideally the same 0.2.x version that
rust-lang/rust uses in [this file][rust-mdbook]. To get it:

[mdBook]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook
[rust-mdbook]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/rustbook/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook --vers [version-num]
```

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
$ mdbook build
```

The output will be in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in
your web browser.

_Firefox:_
```bash
$ firefox book/index.html                       # Linux
$ open -a "Firefox" book/index.html             # OS X
$ Start-Process "firefox.exe" .\book\index.html # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start firefox.exe .\book\index.html           # Windows (Cmd)
```

_Chrome:_
```bash
$ google-chrome book/index.html                 # Linux
$ open -a "Google Chrome" book/index.html       # OS X
$ Start-Process "chrome.exe" .\book\index.html  # Windows (PowerShell)
$ start chrome.exe .\book\index.html            # Windows (Cmd)
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ mdbook test
```

### Translations

We'd love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
a new language! We're waiting on [mdbook support] for multiple languages
before we merge any in, but feel free to start!

## Graphviz dot

We're using [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/) for some of the diagrams in the
book. The source for those files live in the `dot` directory. To turn a `dot`
file, for example, `dot/trpl04-01.dot` into an `svg`, run:

```bash
$ dot dot/trpl04-01.dot -Tsvg > src/img/trpl04-01.svg
```

In the generated SVG, remove the width and the height attributes from the `svg`
element and set the `viewBox` attribute to `0.00 0.00 1000.00 1000.00` or other
values that don't cut off the image.

## Spellchecking

To scan source files for spelling errors, you can use the `spellcheck.sh`
script. It needs a dictionary of valid words, which is provided in
`dictionary.txt`. If the script produces a false positive (say, you used word
`BTreeMap` which the script considers invalid), you need to add this word to
`dictionary.txt` (keep the sorted order for consistency).
