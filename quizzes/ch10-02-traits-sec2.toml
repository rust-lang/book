Because `displayable` returns `impl Display`, then we only know that `s2` is *some* type that implements `Display`, 
not that it is a `String` which has a `push_str` method. Therefore we cannot call `s2.push_str(..)`.

What is the smallest set of trait bounds on `T` needed to make this function type-check?
```
fn f<T: /* ??? */>(t: &T) {
  let t2 = t.clone();
  println!("{t2}");
}
```

Because `clone` is called and the `{}` display brackets are used in a formatter, then `T` must be `Clone` and `Display`.
