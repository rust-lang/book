a value owns data on the heap, then copying it creates an alias, and so it is moved-on-copy.

Consider this function that is a simplified variant of the function from the previous quiz:

```
/// Adds "Ph.D." to a person's name
fn award_phd(name: &String) {
    let mut name = *name;
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
}
```

The Rust compiler rejects this function with the following error:

```text
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*name` which is behind a shared reference
 --> test.rs:3:20
  |
3 |     let mut name = *name;
  |                    ^^^^^
  |                    |
  |                    move occurs because `*name` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  |                    help: consider borrowing here: `&*name`
```

Assume that the compiler did NOT reject this function. Select each (if any) of the following programs that could
possibly cause undefined behavior if executed. If none of these programs could cause undefined behavior, 
then check "None of these programs" .

The statement `let mut name = *name` makes `name` take ownership the input string.
However, the caller also still retains ownership of the string. Therefore after `award_phd`
finishes, the string is deallocated. Therefore every program above has undefined behavior, 
because `name` will eventually be deallocated a second time.

This program does compile, as the binding of `x` copies `point[0]`, allowing `y` to mutably borrow `point[1]`.
The mutation `x += 1` does not affect `point`, while the mutation `*y += 1` does, so the final result is `0 2`.
