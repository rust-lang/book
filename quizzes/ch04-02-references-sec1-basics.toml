Consider the following program, showing the state of memory after the last line:
```aquascope,interpreter
#fn main() {
let x = Box::new(0);
let y = Box::new(&x);`[]`
#}
```

If you wanted to copy out the number `0` through `y`, how many dereferences would you need to use? 
Write your answer as a digit. For example, if the correct expression is `*y`, then the answer is 1. 
"""
answer.answer = "3"
context = """
`***y` is the correct expression. `y` has the type `Box<&Box<i32>>`. It is a heap pointer to a stack reference 
to a heap pointer. Therefore `y` must be dereferenced three times for each layer of indirection.

Which of the following best explains why `v` is not deallocated after calling `get_first`?

References are non-owning pointers. Therefore passing `&v` to `get_first` does not move ownership of `v` into `get_first`,
and subsequently `v` is not deallocated after `get_first` ends.
