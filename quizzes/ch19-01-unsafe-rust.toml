`unsafe` blocks enable you to dereference raw pointers and call `unsafe` functions. However,
`unsafe` does not disable the borrow checker (operations on safe references are still checked).
A reference can be converted to a raw pointer in normal safe code.

This program is dangerous! It compiles correctly and executes without issue
because `Vec` has enough capacity such that `v.push(4)` does not resize it. However,
if the capacity were 3, then `n` would point to deallocated memory.

Two mutable references to disjoint indices is reasonable because the borrow checker doesn't understand when indices are disjoint. See: [`slice::split_at_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_at_mut).

Allowing values to be uninitialized is reasonable because the borrow checker adopts a conservative policy that values must always initialized, but it's sometimes useful to work with uninitialized values. See [`MaybeUninit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html) and the [`take_mut`](https://docs.rs/take_mut/0.2.2/take_mut/index.html) crate.

Having a struct hold a reference to itself is reasonable because the borrow checker cannot
reason about the lifetime of self-references. See the [`std::pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html) module.

However, returning a pointer to a stack-allocated variable is *never* valid to do with unsafe
code. The only appropriate workaround is to use garbage collection, e.g. returning an `Rc<T>`
instead of `&T`.
