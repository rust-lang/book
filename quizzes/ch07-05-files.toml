Imagine a Rust package with the following directory structure:

```text
foobar
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs
    └── engine/
        ├── mod.rs
        └── analysis.rs
```

The contents of each file are:


```
// engine/analysis.rs
pub fn run() {}
```

```
// engine/mod.rs
mod analysis;
pub use analysis::*;
```

```
// lib.rs
pub mod engine;
```

Say that another Rust developer is using the `foobar` library crate in a separate package, and they want to call the `run` function. 
What is the path they would write?

The module tree generated by this directory structure is as follows:

```text
foobar
└── engine
    └── run  
```

Therefore the path to `run` is `foobar::engine::run`.
