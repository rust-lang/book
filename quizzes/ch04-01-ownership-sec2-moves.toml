It can be perfectly safe to have a pointer to freed memory in a stack frame. 
The important thing is to not *use* that pointer again, e.g. by reading it or freeing it.

Say we have a function that moves a box, like this:
```
fn move_a_box(b: Box<i32>) {
  // This space intentionally left blank
}
```

Below are four snippets which are rejected by the Rust compiler. 
Imagine that Rust instead allowed these snippets to compile and run. 
Select each snippet that would cause undefined behavior.

let b = Box::new(0);

The key idea is that when a box is passed to `move_a_box`, its memory is deallocated after `move_a_box` ends.
Therefore:
* Reading `b` via `println` after `move_a_box` is undefined behavior, as it reads freed memory.
* Giving `b` a second owner is undefined behavior, as it would cause Rust to free the box a second time on behalf of `b2`. It doesn't matter whether the `let b2 = b` binding happens
  before or after `move_a_box`.

However, doing `let b2 = b` and then `println` is not undefined behavior. Although `b` is moved, its data is not deallocated until `move_a_box` is called at the end. Therefore 
this program is technically safe, although still rejected by Rust.
