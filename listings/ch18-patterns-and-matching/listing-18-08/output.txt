error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `None` not covered
   --> src/main.rs:3:9
    |
3   |     let Some(x) = some_option_value;
    |         ^^^^^^^ pattern `None` not covered
    |
    = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
    = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html
note: `Option<i32>` defined here
    = note: the matched value is of type `Option<i32>`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched
