error[E0507]: cannot move out of `value`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure
  --> src/main.rs:18:30
   |
15 |     let value = String::from("closure called");
   |         ----- captured outer variable

   |                      --- captured by this `FnMut` closure
18 |         sort_operations.push(value);
   |                              ^^^^^ move occurs because `value` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
