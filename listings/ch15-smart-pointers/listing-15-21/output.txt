error[E0596]: cannot borrow `self.sent_messages` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> src/lib.rs:58:13

   |             ----- help: consider changing that to be a mutable reference: `&mut self`
...

   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `self` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
