error[E0382]: use of moved value: `receiver`
  --> src/lib.rs:26:42
   |
21 |         let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
   |                      -------- move occurs because `receiver` has type `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver<Job>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
25 |         for id in 0..size {
   |         ----------------- inside of this loop
26 |             workers.push(Worker::new(id, receiver));
   |                                          ^^^^^^^^ value moved here, in previous iteration of loop
   |
note: consider changing this parameter type in method `new` to borrow instead if owning the value isn't necessary
  --> src/lib.rs:47:33

   |        --- in this method       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this parameter takes ownership of the value
