error[E0507]: cannot move out of `worker.thread` which is behind a mutable reference
  --> src/lib.rs:52:13
   |
52 |             worker.thread.join().unwrap();
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ------ `worker.thread` moved due to this method call
   |             |
   |             move occurs because `worker.thread` has type `JoinHandle<()>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `worker.thread`
