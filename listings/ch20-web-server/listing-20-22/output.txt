error[E0507]: cannot move out of `worker.thread` which is behind a mutable reference

     |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ------ `worker.thread` moved due to this method call
     |             |
     |             move occurs because `worker.thread` has type `JoinHandle<()>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
     |
note: `JoinHandle::<T>::join` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `worker.thread`
