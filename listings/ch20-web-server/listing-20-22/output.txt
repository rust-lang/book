error[E0507]: cannot move out of `worker.thread` which is behind a mutable reference
    --> src/lib.rs:52:13
     |
52   |             worker.thread.join().unwrap();
     |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ------ `worker.thread` moved due to this method call
     |             |
     |             move occurs because `worker.thread` has type `JoinHandle<()>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
     |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `worker.thread`
