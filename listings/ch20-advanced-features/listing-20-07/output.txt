  = help: this program is using integer-to-pointer casts or (equivalently) `ptr::with_exposed_provenance`, which means that Miri might miss pointer bugs in this program
  = help: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ptr/fn.with_exposed_provenance.html for more details on that operation
  = help: to ensure that Miri does not miss bugs in your program, use Strict Provenance APIs (https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/ptr/index.html#strict-provenance, https://crates.io/crates/sptr) instead
  = help: you can then set `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-strict-provenance` to ensure you are not relying on `with_exposed_provenance` semantics
  = help: alternatively, `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-permissive-provenance` disables this warning

error: Undefined Behavior: pointer not dereferenceable: pointer must be dereferenceable for 40000 bytes, but got 0x1234[noalloc] which is a dangling pointer (it has no provenance)
