Please add this text at the end of The Array Type section, just before the
Accessing Array Elements subsection starts on page 41.

You would write an array’s type by using square brackets, and within the
brackets include the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of
elements in the array, like so:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Here, `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number `5`
indicates the element contains five items.

Writing an array’s type this way looks similar to an alternative syntax for
initializing an array: if you want to create an array that contains the same
value for each element, you can specify the initial value, followed by a
semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
```

The array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the value
`3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];` but in a
more concise way.
