% The Rust Programming Language

There are two editions of "The Rust Programming Language":

* [First edition](first-edition/index.html)
* [Second edition](second-edition/index.html)

The second edition is a complete re-write. It is still under construction;
though it is far enough along to learn most of Rust; we suggest reading the
second edition and then checking out the first edition later to pick up some of
the more esoteric parts of the language.
