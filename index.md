% The Rust Programming Language

The current edition of "The Rust Programming Language" is the second
edition, which you can [read here](second-edition/index.html).

The source for all editions lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).
Please open issues with any questions, concerns, or tweaks.

## Notes

The second edition is still receiving some minor edits, but is effectively
complete. It will be [available in dead-tree form through NoStarch
Press](https://nostarch.com/Rust) once these final edits are complete.

The second edition is a complete re-write of TRPL, from the ground up,
and is therefore very different from the first edition.

## Other editions

We keep older editions of TRPL online for history's sake.

### First Edition
