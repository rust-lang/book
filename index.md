% The Rust Programming Language

There are two editions of "The Rust Programming Language":

* [First edition](first-edition/index.html)
* [Second edition](second-edition/index.html)

The second edition is a complete re-write. It is still under construction,
though it is far enough along to learn most of Rust. We suggest reading the
second edition and then checking out the first edition later to pick up some of
the more esoteric parts of the language.
