# Primitive Rust

We’ll start our journey with Rust by talking about the absolute basics.
Many programming languages have lots in common at their core.
Much of this may feel similar to other languages you’ve used, but some parts are different.
If you want to skip this section, you can, but you may end up coming back later to find out small details.
These foundations will be in every single useful Rust program, and learning them gives us a strong core to start from.
