## Control Flow

Decisions on whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true,
or deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true, are basic
building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that
let us control the flow of execution of our Rust code are `if` expressions and
loops.

### `if` Expressions

An `if` expression allows us to branch our code depending on conditions. We
provide a condition and then say, "If this condition is met, run this
block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code."

Let’s make a new project to explore `if`. Navigate to your projects directory,
and use Cargo to make a new project called `branches`:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin branches
$ cd branches
```

Enter this sample program using `if` and save it in the *branches* directory in
`src/main.rs`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

<!-- we're calling 'if' an expression and 'else' a statement, I just want to double check that's correct? If so, is there a reason one's a statement and the other an expression? -->

All `if` expressions start with they keyword `if`, which is followed by a condition. In this
case, our condition is checking if our variable binding `number` has a value
that is less than 5. The block of code we want to execute if the condition is
true goes immediately after the condition, inside curly braces. These blocks
are sometimes called *arms*. We can optionally also include an `else`
statement, which we have chosen to do here---this gives the program an alternative block of
code to execute should `condition` evaluate to false. If you don't give an else statement and the condition is false, the program will just skip the first arm and do nothing, or move on to the next bit of code.

Try running this code, and you should see output like this:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true
```

Let’s try changing the value of `number` to a value that makes the condition
`false` to see what happens:

```rust,ignore
let number = 7;
```

Run the program again, and look at the output:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false
```

It’s also worth noting that the condition here _must_ be a `bool`. To see what
happens if the condition isn't a `bool`, try running this code:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

The `if` condition evaluates to a value of `3` this time, and Rust will
complain about it:

```bash
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error: mismatched types [--explain E0308]
 --> src/main.rs:4:8
4 |>     if number {
  |>        ^^^^^^ expected bool, found integral variable
note: expected type `bool`
note:    found type `_`

error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `branches`.
```

The error tells us that Rust expected a `bool`, but got an integer. Rust will
not automatically try to convert non-boolean types to a boolean here, unlike
languages like Ruby or JavaScript. We must be explicit and always give `if` a
`boolean` as its condition. If you wanted your `if` code block to run only when a number is not equal to `0`, for example, we would change the `if` expression to read:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
}
```

Running this will print `number was something other than zero`.

#### Multiple Conditions with `else if`

We can have multiple coniditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if`
expression. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 5;

    if number == 3 {
        println!("condition was 3");
    } else if number == 4 {
        println!("condition was 4");
    } else if number == 5 {
        println!("condition was 5");
    } else {
        println!("condition was something else");
    }
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. If you try running it, you
should see output like this:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was 5
```

When this program executes, it will check each `if` expression in turn and
execute the first body for which the condition holds true.

<!--- Will it carry on checking the others, too, or stop at the first true condition and skip the rest? -->

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you find
yourself with more than one, you may want to look at refactoring your code. In
Chapter XX, we'll talk about a powerful Rust branching construct called `match`
for these cases.

#### Using `if` in a Binding

The last detail you need to know about `if` is that it’s an expression. That
means that we can use it on the right hand side of a `let` binding, for
instance:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        6
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

The `number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the `if`
expression. Let’s run this to see what happens:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
The value of number is: 5
```

Remember, blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers
by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the whole `if`
expression depends on which block of code executes. This means that the value
that results from both arms of the `if` must be the same type; in the previous
example, they were both `i32` integers. But what happens if the types are
mismatched, as in the following example?

<!-- Hm, why does it mean the return values must be the same type? Is this to do with Rust needing to know types at compile time? Could you expand on that a little? -->

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        "six"
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```
<!-- Presumably only one of these values will be used --- is this because Rust must infer the type at compile time, so they must be the same, single type for Rust to be able to infer it? That might be worth clarifying explicitly -->

The expression in the `if` block is an integer and the expresion in the `else`
block is a string. This can’t work, because variable bindings must have a
single type. If we try to run this, we’ll get an error:

```bash
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
src/main.rs:4:18: 8:6 error: if and else have incompatible types:
 expected `_`,
    found `&'static str`
(expected integral variable,
    found &-ptr) [E0308]
src/main.rs:4     let number = if condition {
src/main.rs:5         5
src/main.rs:6     } else {
src/main.rs:7         "six"
src/main.rs:8     };
src/main.rs:4:18: 8:6 help: run `rustc --explain E0308` to see a detailed explanation
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `branches`.
```

The `if` and `else` arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust tells
us exactly where to find the problem in our program.

### Repetition with Loops

It’s often useful to be able to execute a block of code more than one time. For
this, Rust has several *loops*. A loop runs through the code
inside the loop body to the end and then starts immediately back at the beginning. To try
out loops, let’s make a new project. Navigate to your *projects* folder and use
Cargo to make a new project:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin loops
$ cd loops
```

There are three kinds of loops in Rust: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Let’s dig
in.

#### Repeating Code with `loop`

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again
forever or until we explicitly tell it to stop.

For an example, change the `src/main.rs` file in your *loops* directory to look
like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

If we run this program, we’ll see `again!` printed over and over continuously
until we stop the program manually. Most terminals support a keyboard shortcut,
`control-c`, to halt a program stuck in a continual loop. Give it a try:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!
```

That `^C` there is where we hit `control-c`. You may or may not see "again!"
printed after the `^C`, depending on where the code was in the loop when it
received the signal to halt.

Fortunately, Rust provides another, more reliable way to break out of a loop.
We can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to
stop executing the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in Chapter 1 to exit
the program when the user won the game by guessing the number correctly.

<!-- Nicely succinct, I like the use of the tutorial chapter in references here -->

#### Conditional Loops With `while`

It's often useful for a program to have a condition that can be evaluated
within a loop. While the condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition
ceases to be true, we call `break`, stopping the loop. This could be
implemented with a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`; you could try that now in a program, if you'd like.

But this pattern is so common that Rust has a more efficient language construct
for it, called a `while` loop. Here's an example using `while`: this program
loops three times, counting down each time. Finally, after the loop, it prints
another message, then exits:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0  {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number = number - 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

This gets rid of a lot of nesting that would be necessary if we used `loop`,
`if`, `else`, and `break`, and it's more clear. While a condition holds, run
this code; otherwise, exit the loop.

#### Looping Through a Collection with `for`

We could use this `while` construct to loop over the elements of a collection,
like an array. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index = index + 1;
    }
}
```

Here, we're counting up through the elements in the array. We start at index 0,
then loop until we hit the final index of our array (that is, when `index < 5`
is no longer true). Running this will print out every element of the array:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
     Running `target/debug/loops`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50
```

All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though `index`
will reach a value of `6` at some point, the loop stops executing before trying
to fetch a sixth value from the array.

This approach is error-prone, though; we could cause our program to panic by
getting the index length incorrect. It's also slow, as the compiler needs to
perform the conditional check on every element on every iteration through the
loop.

As a more efficient alternative, we can use a `for` loop and execute some code
for each item in a collection. A `for` loop looks like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

If we run this, we'll see the same output as the previous example. Importantly,
though, we've now increased the safety of our code and eliminated the chance of
bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not going far enough
and missing some items.

For example, in the previous code that uses the `while` loop, if we removed an
item from the `a` array but forgot to update the condition to `while index <
4`, our code would panic. Using the `for` loop means we would not need to
remember to change any other code if we changed the number of values in the
array.

If you're wondering about the `.iter()` code in this example, keep reading! We
will cover method syntax generally in Chapter XX and iterators specifically in
Chapter XX.

The safety and conciseness of `for` loops make them the most commonly used loop
construct in Rust. Even in situations where you want to run some code a certain
number of times, like our countdown example that used a `while` loop, most
Rustaceans would use a `for` loop. The way to do that would be to use a `Range`, which
is a type provided by the standard library that generates numbers starting from
one number and ending before another number (not dissimilar to the `rand::Rng` type we used in Chapter 2).

Here's what the countdown would
look like with a for loop, and using another method we haven't yet talked
about, `.rev()`, to reverse the range:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

That's a bit nicer, isn't it?

##Summary
<!-- Could you add a conclusion or summary, just summing up what we've been through and how it's useful? It only need be a couple of lines, but can help round a chapter off and keep concepts straight, especially for readers who won't read the chapter in one sitting -->

Now that you know how Rust does things that most other languages can do, let's
talk about a concept that _doesn't_ commonly exist: ownership.
