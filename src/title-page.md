# The Rust Programming Language

*by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community*

Welcome to The Rust Programming Language book! This version of the text assumes
you are using Rust 1.31.0 or later, with `edition="2018"` in *Cargo.toml* of
all projects to use Rust 2018 Edition idioms. See the [“Installation” section
of Chapter 1][install]<!-- ignore --> to install or update Rust, and see
[Appendix E][editions]<!-- ignore --> for information on what editions of Rust
are.

The HTML format is available online at
[https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
and offline with installations of Rust made with `rustup`; run `rustup docs
--book` to open.
