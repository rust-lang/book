## Concurrency With Async

In this section, we’ll apply async to some of the same concurrency challenges
we tackled with threads in chapter 16. Because we already talked about a lot of
the key ideas there, in this section we’ll focus on what’s different between
threads and futures.

In many cases, the APIs for working with concurrency using async are very
similar to those for using threads. In other cases, they end up being shaped
quite differently. Even when the APIs _look_ similar between threads and async,
they often have different behavior—and they nearly always have different
performance characteristics.

### Counting

The first task we tackled in Chapter 16 was counting up on two separate threads.
Let’s do the same using async. The `trpl` crate supplies a `spawn_task` function
which looks very similar to the `thread::spawn` API, and a `sleep` function
which is an async version of the `thread::sleep` API. We can use these together
to implement the same counting example as with threads, in Listing 17-6.

<Listing number="17-6" caption="Using `spawn_task` to count with two" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-06/src/main.rs:all}}
```

</Listing>

As our starting point, we set up our `main` function with `trpl::run`, so
that our top-level function can be async.

> Note: From this point forward in the chapter, every example will include this
> exact same wrapping code with `trpl::run` in `main`, so we’ll often skip it
> just as we do with `main`. Don’t forget to include it in your code!

Then we write two loops within that block, each with a `trpl::sleep` call in it,
which waits for half a second (500 milliseconds) before sending the next
message. We put one loop in the body of a `trpl::spawn_task` and the other in a
top-level `for` loop. We also add an `await` after the `sleep` calls.

This does something similar to the thread-based implementation—including the
fact that you may see the messages appear in a different order in your own
terminal when you run it.

<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;
the changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than

```text
hi number 1 from the second task!
hi number 1 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the second task!
hi number 3 from the first task!
hi number 3 from the second task!
hi number 4 from the first task!
hi number 4 from the second task!
hi number 5 from the first task!
```

This version stops as soon as the for loop in the body of the main async block
finishes, because the task spawned by `spawn_task` is shut down when the main
function ends. If you want to run all the way to the completion of the task, you
will need to use a join handle to wait for the first task to complete. With
threads, we used the `join` method to “block” until the thread was done running.
In Listing 17-7, we can use `await` to do the same thing, because the task
handle itself is a future. Its `Output` type is a `Result`, so we also unwrap it
after awaiting it.

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-07/src/main.rs:handle}}
```

</Listing>

This updated version runs till _both_ loops finish.

<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;

```text
hi number 1 from the second task!
hi number 1 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the second task!
hi number 3 from the first task!
hi number 3 from the second task!
hi number 4 from the first task!
hi number 4 from the second task!
hi number 5 from the first task!
hi number 6 from the first task!
hi number 7 from the first task!
hi number 8 from the first task!
hi number 9 from the first task!
```

So far, it looks like async and threads give us the same basic outcomes, just
with different syntax: using `await` instead of calling `join` on the join
handle, and awaiting the `sleep` calls.

The bigger difference is that we didn’t need to spawn another operating system
thread to do this. In fact, we don’t even need to spawn a task here. Because
async blocks compile to anonymous futures, we can put each loop in an async
block and have the runtime run them both to completion using the `trpl::join`
function.

In Chapter 16, we showed how to use the `join` method on the `JoinHandle` type
returned when you call `std::thread::spawn`. The `trpl::join` function is
similar, but for futures. When you give it two futures, it produces a single new
future whose output is a tuple with the output of each of the futures you passed
in once _both_ complete. Thus, in Listing 17-8, we use `trpl::join` to wait for
both `fut1` and `fut2` to finish. We do _not_ await `fut1` and `fut2`, but
instead the new future produced by `trpl::join`. We ignore the output, because
it’s just a tuple with two unit values in it.

<Listing number="17-8" caption="Using `trpl::join` to await two anonymous futures" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-08/src/main.rs:join}}
```

</Listing>

When we run this, we see both futures run to completion:

<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;
the changes are likely to be due to the threads running differently rather than
changes in the compiler -->

```text
hi number 1 from the first task!
hi number 1 from the second task!
hi number 2 from the first task!
hi number 2 from the second task!
hi number 3 from the first task!
hi number 3 from the second task!
hi number 4 from the first task!
hi number 4 from the second task!
hi number 5 from the first task!
hi number 6 from the first task!
hi number 7 from the first task!
hi number 8 from the first task!
hi number 9 from the first task!
```

Here, you’ll see the exact same order every time, which is very different from
what we saw with threads. That is because the `trpl::join` function is _fair_,
meaning it checks each future equally often, alternating between them, and never
lets one race ahead if the other is ready. With threads, the operating system
decides which thread to check and how long to let it run. With async Rust, the
runtime decides which task to check. (In practice, the details get complicated
because an async runtime might use operating system threads under the hood as
part of how it manages concurrency, so guaranteeing fairness can be more work
for a runtime—but it’s still possible!) Runtimes don’t have to guarantee
fairness for any given operation, and runtimes often offer different APIs to let
you choose whether you want fairness or not.

Try some of these different variations on awaiting the futures and see what they
do:

- Remove the async block from around either or both of the loops.
- Await each async block immediately after defining it.
- Wrap only the first loop in an async block, and await the resulting future
  after the body of second loop.

For an extra challenge, see if you can figure out what the output will be in
each case _before_ running the code!

### Message Passing

Sharing data between futures will also be familiar: we’ll use message passing
again, but this with async versions of the types and functions. We’ll take a
slightly different path than we did in Chapter 16, to illustrate some of the key
differences between thread-based and futures-based concurrency. In Listing 17-9,
we’ll begin with just a single async block—_not_ spawning a separate task as
we spawned a separate thread.

<Listing number="17-9" caption="Creating an async channel and assigning the two halves to `tx` and `rx`" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-09/src/main.rs:channel}}
```

</Listing>

Here, we use `trpl::channel`, an async version of the multiple-producer,
single-consumer channel API we used with threads back in Chapter 16. The async
version of the API is only a little different from the thread-based version: it
uses a mutable rather than an immutable receiver `rx`, and its `recv` method
produces a future we need to await rather than producing the value directly. Now
we can send messages from the sender to the receiver. Notice that we don’t have
to spawn a separate thread or even a task; we merely need to await the `rx.recv`
call.

The synchronous `Receiver::recv` method in `std::mpsc::channel` blocks until
it receives a message. The `trpl::Receiver::recv` method does not, because it
is async. Instead of blocking, it hands control back to the runtime until either
a message is received or the send side of the channel closes. By contrast, we
don’t await the `send` call, because it doesn’t block. It doesn’t need to,
because the channel we’re sending it into is unbounded.

Notice two things about this example: First, the message will arrive right away!
Second, although we use a future here, there’s no concurrency yet. Everything
in the listing happens in sequence, just as it would if there were no futures
involved.

Let’s address the first part by sending a series of messages, and sleep in
between them, as shown in Listing 17-10:

<!-- We cannot test this one because it never stops! -->

<Listing number="17-10" caption="Sending and receiving multiple messages over the async channel and sleeping with an `await` between each message" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-10/src/main.rs:many-messages}}
```

</Listing>

In addition to sending the messages, we need to receive them. In this case, we
could do that manually, by just doing `rx.recv().await` four times, because we
know how many messages are coming in. In the real world, though, we’ll
generally be waiting on some _unknown_ number of messages. In that case, we need
to keep waiting until we determine that there are no more messages.

In Listing 16-10, we used a `for` loop to process all the items received from a
synchronous channel. However, Rust doesn’t yet have a way to write a `for` loop
over an _asynchronous_ series of items. Instead, we need to use a new kind of
loop we haven’t seen before, the `while let` conditional loop. A `while let`
loop is the loop version of the `if let` construct we saw back in Chapter 6. The
loop will continue executing as long as the pattern it specifies continues to
match the value.

The `rx.recv` call produces a `Future`, which we await. The runtime will pause
the `Future` until it is ready. Once a message arrives, the future will resolve
to `Some(message)`, as many times as a message arrives. When the channel closes,
regardless of whether _any_ messages have arrived, the future will instead
resolve to `None` to indicate that there are no more values, and we should stop
polling—that is, stop awaiting.

The `while let` loop pulls all of this together. If the result of calling
`rx.recv().await` is `Some(message)`, we get access to the message and we can
use it in the loop body, just as we could with `if let`. If the result is
`None`, the loop ends. Every time the loop completes, it hits the await point
again, so the runtime pauses it again until another message arrives.

The code now successfully sends and receives all of the messages. Unfortunately,
there are still a couple problems. For one thing, the messages do not arrive at
half-second intervals. They arrive all at once, two seconds (2,000 milliseconds)
after we start the program. For another, this program also never exits! Instead,
it waits forever for new messages. You will need to shut it down using <span
class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span>.

Let’s start by understanding why the messages all come in at once after the full
delay, rather than coming in with delays in between each one. Within a given
async block, the order that `await` keywords appear in the code is also the
order they happen when running the program.

There’s only one async block in Listing 17-10, so everything in it runs
linearly. There’s still no concurrency. All the `tx.send` calls happen,
interspersed with all of the `trpl::sleep` calls and their associated await
points. Only then does the `while let` loop get to go through any of the `await`
points on the `recv` calls.

To get the behavior we want, where the sleep delay happens between receiving
each message, we need to put the `tx` and `rx` operations in their own async
blocks. Then the runtime can execute each of them separately using `trpl::join`,
just as in the counting example. Once again, we await the result of calling
`trpl::join`, not the individual futures. If we awaited the individual futures
in sequence, we would just end up back in a sequential flow—exactly what we’re
trying _not_ to do.

<!-- We cannot test this one because it never stops! -->

<Listing number="17-11" caption="Separating `send` and `recv` into their own `async` blocks and awaiting the futures for those blocks" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust,ignore
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-11/src/main.rs:futures}}
```

</Listing>

With the updated code in Listing 17-11, the messages get printed at
500-millisecond intervals, rather than all in a rush after two seconds.

The program still never exits, though, because of the way `while let` loop
interacts with `trpl::join`:

- The future returned from `trpl::join` only completes once _both_ futures
  passed to it have completed.
- The `tx` future completes once it finishes sleeping after sending the last
  message in `vals`.
- The `rx` future won’t complete until the `while let` loop ends.
- The `while let` loop won’t end until awaiting `rx.recv` produces `None`.
- Awaiting `rx.recv` will only return `None` once the other end of the channel
  is closed.
- The channel will only close if we call `rx.close` or when the sender side,
  `tx`, is dropped.
- We don’t call `rx.close` anywhere, and `tx` won’t be dropped until the
  outermost async block passed to `trpl::run` ends.
- The block can’t end because it is blocked on `trpl::join` completing, which
  takes us back to the top of this list!

We could manually close `rx` by calling `rx.close` somewhere, but that doesn’t
make much sense. Stopping after handling some arbitrary number of messages would
make the program shut down, but we could miss messages. We need some other way
to make sure that `tx` gets dropped _before_ the end of the function.

Right now, the async block where we send the messages only borrows `tx` because
sending a message doesn’t require ownership, but if we could move `tx` into
that async block, it would be dropped once that block ends. In Chapter 13, we
learned how to use the `move` keyword with closures, and in Chapter 16, we saw
that we often need to move data into closures when working with threads. The
same basic dynamics apply to async blocks, so the `move` keyword works with
async blocks just as it does with closures.

In Listing 17-12, we change the async block for sending messages from a plain
`async` block to an `async move` block. When we run _this_ version of the code,
it shuts down gracefully after the last message is sent and received.

<Listing number="17-12" caption="A working example of sending and receiving messages between futures which correctly shuts down when complete" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-12/src/main.rs:with-move}}
```

</Listing>

This async channel is also a multiple-producer channel, so we can call `clone`
on `tx` if we want to send messages from multiple futures. In Listing 17-13, we
clone `tx`, creating `tx1` outside the first async block. We move `tx1` into
that block just as we did before with `tx`. Then, later, we move the original
`tx` into a _new_ async block, where we send more messages on a slightly slower
delay. We happen to put this new async block after the async block for receiving
messages, but it could go before it just as well. The key is the order of the
futures are awaited in, not the order they are created in.

Both of the async blocks for sending messages need to be `async move` blocks, so
that both `tx` and `tx1` get dropped when those blocks finish. Otherwise we’ll
end up back in the same infinite loop we started out in. Finally, we switch from
`trpl::join` to `trpl::join3` to handle the additional future.

<Listing number="17-13" caption="Using multiple producers with async blocks" file-name="src/main.rs">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-13/src/main.rs:here}}
```

</Listing>

Now we see all the messages from both sending futures. Because the sending
futures use slightly different delays after sending, the messages are also
received at those different intervals.

<!-- Not extracting output because changes to this output aren't significant;

changes in the compiler -->

```text
received 'hi'
received 'more'
received 'from'
received 'the'
received 'messages'
received 'future'
received 'for'
received 'you'
```

This is a good start, but it limits us to just a handful of futures: two with
`join`, or three with `join3`. Let’s see how we might work with more futures.
