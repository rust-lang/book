## Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain *type*, which tells Rust what kind of data
is being given so it knows how to work with that data. In this section, we'll
look at a number of types built into the language itself split into two subsets:
scalar and compound.

Something to keep in mind throughout this section: Rust is a *statically typed*
language, which means that it must know the types of all bindings at compile
time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the
value and how we use it. When many types are possible, such as when we
converted a `String` to a numeric type using `parse()` in Chapter 2,
we can add a type annotation, like this:

<!-- We **can** add a type annotation, or we **need to** add a type annotation? What does Rust do if there are multiple options and we don't annotate type? -->

```rust,ignore
let x: i32 = 5;
```

You will see some type annotations as we discuss the various data types.

### Scalar Types

A *scalar* type represents a single value. There are four key
scalar types in Rust: integers, floating point numbers, booleans, and
characters. You'll likely recognize these from other programming languages, but
let's jump into how they work in Rust.

#### Integer Types

An *integer* is a number without a fractional component. We've used one integer
type already in this chapter, the `i32` type. This type declaration indicates
that the value it's associated with should be a signed integer (hence the `i`,
as opposed to a `u` for unsigned) for a 32-bit system. There are a number of
built-in integer types in Rust, shown in Table 3-1.

| Length | signed | unsigned |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit | i64    | u64      |
| arch   | isize  | usize    |

*Table 3-1: Integer types in Rust. Each type code (for example, i32) can be used to
declare the type of a value.*

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed
and unsigned merely refers to whether it is possible for the number to be
either negative or positive; in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it
("signed"), or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be
represented without a sign ("unsigned"). It's like writing numbers on paper:
when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or minus sign, but
when it's safe to assume the number is positive, it's shown with no sign.
Signed numbers are stored using twoâ€™s complement representation (if you're
unsure what this is you can search for it online; an explanation is outside the
scope of this text).

Finally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the kind of computer your
program is running on: 64-bits if you're on a 64-bit architecture, and 32-bits
if youâ€™re on a 32-bit architecture.

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you're unsure, Rust's
defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to `i32`: itâ€™s
generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which
you'd need to specify `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of
collection, which we'll talk about in the "Arrays" section.

#### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for *floating-point numbers*, which are
numbers with decimal points. Rust's floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`,
as itâ€™s roughly the same speed as `f32`, but has a larger precision. It is
possible to use an `f64` on 32 bit systems, but it will be slower than using an
`f32` on those systems. Most of the time, trading potential worse performance
for better precision is a reasonable initial choice, and you should benchmark
your code if you suspect floating-point size is a problem in your case.
<!-- Is it safe to assume the reader will be experienced to know whether this would be a problem in their case, or is it worth giving an example? -->

Here's an example showing floating-point numbers in action:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The
`f32` type is a single-precision float, while `f64` has double-precision.

#### Numeric Operations

Rust supports the usual basic mathematic operations youâ€™d expect for all of
these number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
modulo. This code shows how you'd use each one in a `let` statement:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // modulo
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates
to a single value, which is then bound to a variable.

#### The Boolean Type

As in most other programming languages, a boolean type in Rust has two possible
values: `true` and `false`. The boolean type in Rust is specified with `bool`.
For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

The main way to consume boolean values is through conditionals like an `if`
statement. Weâ€™ll cover how `if` statements work in Rust in the "Control Flow"
section of this chapter.

#### The Character Type

So far weâ€™ve only worked with numbers, but Rust supports letters too. Rustâ€™s
`char` type is the language's most primitive alphabetic type, and this code
shows one way to use it:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
   let c = 'z';
   let z = 'â„¤';
   let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

Rustâ€™s `char` represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means that it can
represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean
ideographs, emoji, and zero width spaces are all valid `char`s in Rust. Unicode
Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF`
inclusive. A "character" isnâ€™t really a concept in Unicode, however, so your
human intuition for what a "character" is may not match up with what a `char`
is in Rust.
<!-- Will this ever be a problem in the code? Would it be worth mentioning an example of when this might occur? -->

It also means that `char`s are four bytes each. You can learn more
about Unicode Scalar Values at
*http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value* and find a chart for
all unicode code points at *http://www.unicode.org/charts/*.

<!-- This first link doesn't actually give that much information, just a line of definition---I'm not sure it's that helpful, do you have another link you want to give? -->

#### The Byte Type

You can work with the bytes of data directly. Byte literals can be created from
the ASCII characters using `b` and single quotes:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let byte = b'a';
    println!("byte is {}", byte);
}
```

This will print `byte is 97`. Similarly, byte string literals can be created
using `b` and double quotes, like `b"some byte string"`. Note that since you are
limited to ASCII characters, it's a best practice to use characters instead of
bytes when you're working with natural language text.

### Compound Types

*Compound types* can group multiple values of other types into one type. Rust
has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### Grouping Values into Tuples

<!-- I don't think we've looked at binding multiple values in this version of the chapter -- do you want to add that section in, or should we just change the text below? -->

Weâ€™ve seen tuples already, when binding multiple values at once. A tuple is a
general way of grouping together some number of other values with distinct
types into one compound type.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a distinct type, as in this example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

Note that, unlike the examples of multiple bindings, here we bind the single
name `tup` to the entire tuple, emphasizing the fact that a tuple is considered
a single compound element. We could then use pattern matching to destructure
this tuple value, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

In this program, we first create a tuple and bind it to the name `tup`. We then
use a pattern with `let` to take `tup` and turn it into three separate
bindings, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called *destructuring*, because it breaks
the single tuple into three parts.

Finally, we print the value of `y`, which is `6.4`.

<!-- if you were to create a tuple with elements of all the same type, would you still have to repeat it, like:
let tup: (i32, i32, i32) = (500, 6, 15);
or would
let tup: (i32) = (500, 6, 15);
do? Or would you just use an array for that? Might be worth specifying,  -->

#### Tuple Indexing

In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can also access a
tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed by the index of the
value we want to access. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

This program creates a tuple, `x`, and then makes new bindings to each element
by using their index. As with most programming languages, the first index in a
tuple is 0.

### Arrays

Another way to bind a name to a collection of multiple values is with an
*array*. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
Arrays in Rust are different than arrays in some other languages because arrays
in Rust have a fixed length-- once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma separated list
inside square brackets:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

While arrays can be useful since they are a primitive type, they aren't as
flexible as the `Vec` (short for "vector"), a similar collection type provided
by the standard library that _is_ allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you're
unsure whether to use an array or a `Vec`, you should probably go with a `Vec`,
and we'll discuss them in more detail in chapter XX.

<!-- Could you say why you might an array at all then, rather than just a Vec? What's the advantage  of an array? -->

#### Accessing Array Elements

An array is a single chunk of memory, allocated on the stack. We can access
elements of an array using indexing, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

In this example, the `first` variable will bind to `1` at index `[0]` in the
array, and `second` will bind to `2` at index `[1]` in the array. Note that
these values are copied from the array and into `first` and `second` when the
`let` statement is called. That means if the array changes after the `let`
statements, these bindings will not, and the two variables should retain their
values.

#### Invalid Array Element Access

What happens if you try to access an element of an array past the end of the
array? Say we changed our program to:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let element = a[10];

    println!("The value of element is: {}", element);
}
```

Running this code with `cargo run` produces:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling arrays v0.1.0 (file:///projects/arrays)
     Running `target/debug/arrays`
thread '<main>' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:4
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
error: Process didn't exit successfully: `target/debug/arrays` (exit code: 101)
```

We can see that the compilation did not give us any errors, but we got a *runtime*
error and our program didn't exit successfully. When we attempt to access an
element using indexing, Rust will check that the index we've specified is less
than the array length. If the index is greater than the length, it will
"panic", which is what it's called when a Rust program exits with an error.

This is our first example of Rustâ€™s safety principles in action. In many
low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an
incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects us against this
kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and
continuing. We'll discuss more of Rustâ€™s error handling in Chapter XX.
