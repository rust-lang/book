## Method Syntax

*Methods* are similar to functions: they're declared with the `fn` keyword and
their name, they can take arguments and return values, and they contain some
code that gets run when they're called from somewhere else. Methods are
different from functions, however, because they're defined within the context
of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we will cover in Chapters 6
and XX respectively), and their first argument is always `self`, which
represents the instance of the struct that the method is being called on.

### Defining Methods

Let's change our `area` function that takes a `Rectangle` instance as an
argument and instead make an `area` method defined on the `Rectangle` struct:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    length: u32,
    width: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.length * self.width
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { length: 50, width: 30 };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings here in libreoffice /Carol -->

In order to make the function be defined within the context of `Rectangle`, we
start an `impl` block (`impl` is short for *implementation*). Then we move the
function within the `impl` curly braces, and change the first (and in this
case, only) argument to be `self` in the signature and everywhere within the
body. Then in `main` where we called the `area` function and passed `rect1` as
an argument, we can instead use *method syntax* to call the `area` method on
our `Rectangle` instance.

In the signature for `area`, we get to use `&self` instead of `rectangle:
&Rectangle` because Rust knows the type of `self` is `Rectangle` due to this
method being inside the `impl Rectangle` context. Note we still need to have
the `&` before `self`, just like we had `&Rectangle`. Methods can choose to
take ownership of `self`, borrow `self` immutably as we've done here, or borrow
`self` mutably, just like any other argument.

We've chosen `&self` here for the same reason we used `&Rectangle` in the
function version: we don't want to take ownership, and we just want to be able
to read the data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to be able to
change the instance that we've called the method on as part of what the method
does, we'd put `&mut self` as the first argument instead. Having a method that
takes ownership of the instance by having just `self` as the first argument is
rarer; this is usually used when the method transforms `self` into something
else and we want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after
the transformation.

The main benefit of using methods over functions, in addition to getting to use
method syntax and not having to repeat the type of `self` in every method's
signature, is for organization. We've put all the things we can do with an
instance of a type together in one `impl` block, rather than make future users
of our code search for capabilities of `Rectangle` all over the place.

> #     x: f64,
> #     y: f64,

> #        let x_squared = f64::powi(other.x - self.x, 2);
> #        let y_squared = f64::powi(other.y - self.y, 2);
> #
> #        f64::sqrt(x_squared + y_squared)
> #    }
> # }
> # let p1 = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
> # let p2 = Point { x: 5.0, y: 6.5 };
> p1.distance(&p2);
> (&p1).distance(&p2);
> ```

> receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the

### Methods with More Arguments

Let's practice some more with methods by implementing a second method on our
`Rectangle` struct. This time, we'd like for an instance of `Rectangle` to take
another instance of `Rectangle` and return `true` if the second rectangle could
fit completely within `self` and `false` if it would not. That is, if we run
this code:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { length: 50, width: 30 };
    let rect2 = Rectangle { length: 40, width: 10 };
    let rect3 = Rectangle { length: 45, width: 60 };

    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
}
```

We want to see this output, since both of `rect2`'s dimensions are smaller than
`rect1`'s, but `rect3` is wider than `rect1`:

```bash
Can rect1 hold rect2? true
Can rect1 hold rect3? false
```

We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the `impl Rectangle`
block. The method name will be `can_hold`, and it will take an immutable borrow
of another `Rectangle` as an argument. We can tell what the type of the
argument will be by looking at a call site: `rect1.can_hold(&rect2)` passes in
`&rect2`, which is an immutable borrow to `rect2`, an instance of `Rectangle`.
This makes sense, since we only need to read `rect2` (rather than write, which
would mean we'd need a mutable borrow) and we want `main` to keep ownership of
`rect2` so that we could use it again after calling this method. The return
value of `can_hold` will be a boolean, and the implementation will check to see
if `self`'s length and width are both greater than the length and width of the
other `Rectangle`, respectively. Let's write that code!

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    length: u32,
    width: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.length * self.width
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.length > other.length && self.width > other.width
    }
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting here in libreoffice /Carol -->

If we run this with the `main` from earlier, we will get our desired output!
Methods can take multiple arguments that we add to the signature after the
`self` parameter, and those arguments work just like arguments in functions do.

### Associated Functions

One more useful feature of `impl` blocks: we're allowed to define functions
within `impl` blocks that *don't* take `self` as a parameter. These are called
*associated functions*, since they're associated with the struct. They're still
functions though, not methods, since they don't have an instance of the struct
to work with. You've already used an associated function: `String::from`.

Associated functions are often used for constructors that will return a new
instance of the struct. For example, we could provide an associated function
that would take one dimension argument and use that as both length and width,
thus making it easier to create a square `Rectangle` rather than having to
specify the same value twice:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    length: u32,
    width: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle { length: size, width: size }
    }
}
```

To call this associated function, we use the `::` syntax with the struct name:
`let sq = Rectange::square(3);`, for example. It's kind of this function is
namespaced by the struct: the `::` syntax is used for both associated functions
and namespaces created by modules, which we'll learn about in Chapter 7.

## Summary

Structs let us create custom types that are meaningful for our domain. By using
structs, we can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other and name
each piece to make our code clear. Methods let us specify the behavior that
instances of our structs have, and associated functions let us namespace
functionality that is particular to our struct without having an instance
available.

Structs aren't the only way we can create custom types, though; let's turn to
the `enum` feature of Rust and add another tool to our toolbox.
