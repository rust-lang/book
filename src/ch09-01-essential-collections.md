# Essential Collections

Rust's standard library includes a number of really useful data structures
called 'collections'. Most types represent one specific value, but collections
can contain multiple values inside of them. Each collection has different
capabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for the situation you're
in is a skill you'll develop over time. In this chapter, we'll go over three
collections which are used very often in Rust programs:

* *Vector*s allow you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
* We've seen *String*s before, but we'll talk about them some more: they're
  collections of characters.
* *HashMap*s allow you to associate a value with a particular key.

There are more specialized variants of each of these data structures for
special situations, but these are the most fundamental.
