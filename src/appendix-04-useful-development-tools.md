# Appendix D - Useful Development Tools

In this appendix, we’ll talk about tools provided by the Rust project that are
useful when developing Rust code.

## Automatic Formatting with `rustfmt`

The tool `rustfmt` reformats your code according to the community code style.
Many projects use `rustfmt` to prevent arguments about which style to use when
writing Rust: everyone formats their code with the tool!

The `rustfmt` tool is not yet at the quality of a version 1.0 release, but
a preview is available for you to use in the meantime. Please give it a try and
let us know how it goes!

To install `rustfmt`:

```text
$ rustup component add rustfmt-preview
```

This will give you both `rustfmt` and `cargo-fmt`, similar to how Rust gives
you both `rustc` and `cargo`. To take any Cargo project and format it:

```text
$ cargo fmt
```

Running this command will reformat all of the Rust code in the current crate.
This should only change the code style, not the code semantics. For more
information on `rustfmt`, see [its documentation][rustfmt].

## Fix Up Your Code with `rustfix`

If you’ve written code in Rust, you’ve probably seen compiler warnings. For
example, consider this code:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    for i in 0..100 {
        do_something();
    }
}
```

Here, we’re calling the `do_something` function 100 times, but we never use the
variable `i` in the body of the `for` loop. Rust warns us about that:

```text
$ cargo build
   Compiling myprogram v0.1.0 (file:///projects/myprogram)
warning: unused variable: `i`
 --> src/main.rs:4:9
  |
4 |     for i in 1..100 {
  |         ^ help: consider using `_i` instead
  |
  = note: #[warn(unused_variables)] on by default

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.50s
```

The warning suggests that we use `_i` as a name instead: the underscore
indicates that we intend for this variable to be unused. We can automatically
apply that suggestion using the `rustfix` tool by running the command `cargo
fix`:

```text
$ cargo fix
    Checking myprogram v0.1.0 (file:///projects/myprogram)
      Fixing src/main.rs (1 fix)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s
```

If we look at *src/main.rs* again, we’ll see that `cargo fix` has changed the
code:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn do_something() {}

fn main() {
    for _i in 0..100 {
        do_something();
    }
}
```

The `for` loop variable is now named `_i`, and the warning will no longer
appear.

The `cargo fix` command can also be used to transition your code between
different editions of Rust. Editions are covered in Appendix E.

## More Lints with `clippy`

The `clippy` tool is a collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve
your Rust code.

The `clippy` tool is not yet at the quality of a version 1.0 release, but a
preview is available for you to use in the meantime. Please give it a try and
let us know how it goes!

To install `clippy`:

```text
$ rustup component add clippy-preview
```

To take any Cargo project and run clippy’s lints on it:

```text
$ cargo clippy
```

For example, if you write a program that uses an approximation of a
mathematical constant such as pi, as this program does:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 3.1415;
    let r = 8.0;
    println!("the area of the circle is {}", x * r * r);
}
```

Running `cargo clippy` on this project will result in this error:

```text
error: approximate value of `f{32, 64}::consts::PI` found. Consider using it directly
 --> src/main.rs:2:13
  |
2 |     let x = 3.1415;
  |             ^^^^^^
  |
  = note: #[deny(clippy::approx_constant)] on by default
  = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-clippy/v0.0.212/index.html#approx_constant
```

This lets you know that Rust has this constant defined more precisely, and that
your program would be more correct if you used the constant instead. This code
doesn’t result in any errors or warnings from `clippy`:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = std::f64::consts::PI;
    let r = 8.0;
    println!("the area of the circle is {}", x * r * r);
}
```

## IDE Integration Using the Rust Language Server

To help IDE integration, the Rust project distributes the `rls`, which stands
for the Rust Language Server. This tool speaks the [Language Server
Protocol][lsp], which is a specification for IDEs and programming languages to
communicate with each other. The `rls` can be used by different clients, such
as [the Rust plugin for Visual Studio: Code][vscode].

[lsp]: http://langserver.org/
[vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust

The `rls` is not yet at the quality of a version 1.0 release, but a preview is
available for you to use in the meantime. Please give it a try and let us know
how it goes!

To install the `rls`:

```text
$ rustup component add rls-preview
```

Then install the language server support in your particular IDE, and you will
gain abilities such as autocompletion, jump to definition, and inline errors.

For more information on the `rls`, see [its documentation][rls].
