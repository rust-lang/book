# More About Cargo and Crates.io

So far we’ve used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and test
our code, but it can do a lot more. In this chapter, we’ll discuss some of its
other, more advanced features to show you how to do the following:

* Customize your build through release profiles
* Publish libraries on [crates.io](https://crates.io/)<!-- ignore -->
* Organize large projects with workspaces
* Install binaries from [crates.io](https://crates.io/)<!-- ignore -->
* Extend Cargo using custom commands

Cargo can do even more than what we cover in this chapter, so for a full
explanation of all its features, see [its
documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
