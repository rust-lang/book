# Up and Running

We’ll start our Rust journey by talking about the absolute basics, concepts
that appear in almost every programming language. Many programming languages
have much in common at their core. None of the concepts presented in this
chapter are unique to Rust, but we’ll discuss Rust’s particular syntax and
conventions concerning these common concepts.

Specifically, we’ll be talking about variable bindings, functions, basic types,
comments, `if` statements, and looping. These foundations will be in every Rust
program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
