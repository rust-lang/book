# Common Programming Concepts in Rust

Now that we've seen some of the features that make Rust unique, let's look at
concepts that appear in almost every programming language and see how they work
in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at their core. None of
the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust, but we’ll discuss
Rust’s particular syntax and conventions concerning these common concepts.

Specifically, we’ll be talking about variable bindings, basic types, functions,
comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust
program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
