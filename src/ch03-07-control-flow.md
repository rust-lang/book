## Control Flow

Deciding whether or not to run some code depending on if a condition is true,
or deciding to run some code repeatedly while a condition is true, are basic
building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that
let us control the flow of execution of our Rust code are `if` expressions and
loops.

An `if` expression allows us to branch our code depending on conditions. We
provide a condition and then say, "If this condition is met, then run this
block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code."

Let’s make a new project to explore `if`. Navigate to your projects directory,
and use Cargo to make a new project called `branches`:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin branches
$ cd branches
```

Write this sample program using `if` and save it in the *branches* directory in
`src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    if condition {
        println!("condition was true");
    }
}
```

The `condition` variable is a boolean; here, it's set to true. All `if`
expressions start with `if`, which is followed by a condition. The block of code
we want to execute if the condition is true goes immediately after the
condition, inside curly braces. These blocks are sometimes called ‘arms’.

Try running this code, and you should see output like this:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true
```

Let’s try changing the value of `condition` to `false` as follows to see what
happens:

```rust
    let condition = false;
```

Run the program again, and look at the output:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
```

Nothing was output, because the condition was false and the `if` block was not
run.

We can optionally also include an `else` statement, which gives the program a
block of code to execute should `condition` evaluate to false.

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = false;

    if condition {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

If we run this program, the output will look like:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false
```

This time, because `condition` was false and we have an `else` block, the
`else` block was executed.

It’s also worth noting that `condition` here _must_ be a `bool`. To see what
happens if the condition isn't a `bool`, try running this code:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let condition = 5;

    if condition {
        println!("condition was five");
    }
}
```

The `condition` variable is assigned a value of `5` this time, and Rust will
complain about it:

```bash
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
src/main.rs:4:8: 4:17 error: mismatched types:
 expected `bool`,
    found `_`
(expected bool,
    found integral variable) [E0308]
src/main.rs:4     if condition {
                     ^~~~~~~~~
src/main.rs:4:8: 4:17 help: run `rustc --explain E0308` to see a detailed explanation
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `branches`.
```

The error tells us that Rust expected a `bool`, but got an integer. Rust will
not automatically try to convert non-boolean types to a boolean here, unlike
languages like Ruby or JavaScript. We must be explicit and always give `if` a
`boolean` as its condition. If your intention is for the `if` code block to be run if a number is not equal to `0`, for example, we would change the `if` expression to read:

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = 5;

    if condition != 0 {
        println!("condition was something other than zero");
    }
}
```

Running this will print "condition was something other than zero".

#### Multiple Conditions with `else if`

We can have multiple coniditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if`
expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 5;

    if number == 3 {
        println!("condition was 3");
    } else if number == 4 {
        println!("condition was 4");
    } else if number == 5 {
        println!("condition was 5");
    } else {
        println!("condition was something else");
    }
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. If you try running it, you
should see output like this:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was 5
```

When this program executes, it will check each `if` expression in turn and
execute the first body for which the condition holds true.

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you find
yourself with more than one, you may want to look at refactoring your code. In
Chapter XX, we'll talk about a powerful Rust branching construct called `match`
for these cases.

#### Using `if` in a Binding

The last detail you need to learn about `if` is that it’s an expression. That
means that we can use it on the right hand side of a `let` binding, for
instance:

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        6
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

The `number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the `if`
expression. Let’s run this to see what happens:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
     Running `target/debug/branches`
The value of number is: 5
```

Remember, blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers
by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the whole `if`
expression depends on which block of code executes. This means that the value
that results from both arms of the `if` must be the same type; in the previous
example, they were both `i32` integers. But what happens if the types are
mismatched, as in the following example?

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        "six"
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

The expression in the `if` block is an integer and the expresion in the `else`
block is a string. This can’t work, because variable bindings must have a
single type. If we try to run this, we’ll get an error:

```bash
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
src/main.rs:4:18: 8:6 error: if and else have incompatible types:
 expected `_`,
    found `&‘static str`
(expected integral variable,
    found &-ptr) [E0308]
src/main.rs:4     let number = if condition {
src/main.rs:5         5
src/main.rs:6     } else {
src/main.rs:7         "six"
src/main.rs:8     };
src/main.rs:4:18: 8:6 help: run `rustc --explain E0308` to see a detailed explanation
error: aborting due to previous error
Could not compile `branches`.
```

The `if` and `else` arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust tells
us exactly where to find the problem in our program.

### Repetition with Loops

It’s often useful to be able to execute a block of code more than one time. For
this, Rust has several constructs called *loops*. A loop runs through the code
inside it to the end and then starts immediately back at the beginning. To try
out loops, let’s make a new project. Navigate to your *projects* folder and use
Cargo to make a new project:

```bash
$ cargo new --bin loops
$ cd loops
```

There are three kinds of loops in Rust: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Let’s dig
in.

#### Repeating Code with `loop`

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again
forever or until we explicitly tell it to stop.

For an example, change the *src/main.rs* file in your *loops* directory to look
like this:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

If we run this program, we’ll see `again!` printed over and over continuously
until we stop the program manually. Most terminals support a keyboard shortcut,
`control-c`, to halt a program stuck in a continual loop. Give it a try:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!
```

That `^C` there is where I hit `control-c`. You may or may not see "again!" printed after the `^C`, depending on where the code was in the loop when it received the signal to halt.

Fortunately, Rust provides another, more reliable way to break out of a loop.
We can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to
stop executing the loop. Try this version of the program out:

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("once!");
        break;
    }
}
```

If you run this program, you’ll see that it only executes one time:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
     Running `target/debug/loops`
once!
```

When a Rust program hits a `break` statement, it will exit the current loop.
This on its own is not very useful; if we wanted to print somtheing just once,
we wouldn't put it in a loop. This is where conditions come in again.

#### Conditional Loops With `while`

To make `break` useful, we need to give our program a condition. While the
condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be true, the
`break` code runs, stopping the loop.

Try this example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    loop {
        if number != 0 {
            println!("{}!", number);

            number = number - 1;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

If we run this, we’ll get:

```bash
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
     Running `target/debug/loops`
3!
2!
1!
LIFTOFF!!!
```

This program loops three times, counting down each time. Finally, after the
loop, it prints another message, then exits.

The core of this example is in the combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and
`break`. We want to `loop`, but only while some sort of condition is true. As
soon as it isn't, we want to `break` out of the loop. This pattern is so common
that Rust has a more efficient language construct for it, called a `while`
loop. Here's the same example, but using `while` instead:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0  {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number = number - 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

This gets rid of a lot of nesting, and it's more clear. While a condition
holds, run this code; otherwise, do nothing.

#### Looping Though a Collection with `for`

We can use this `while` construct to loop over the elements of a collection,
like an array. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index = index + 1;
    }
}
```

Here, we're counting up through the elements in the array. We start at index 0,
then loop until we hit the final index of our array (that is, when `index < 5`
is no longer true). Running this will print out every element of the array:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
     Running `target/debug/loops`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50
```

All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though `index`
will reach a value of `6` at some point, the loop stops executing before trying
to fetch a sixth value from the array.

This approach is error-prone, though; we could cause our program to panic by
getting the index length incorrect. It's also slow, as the compiler needs to
perform the conditional check on every element on every iteration through the
loop.

As a more efficient alternative, we can use a `for` loop and execute some code
for each item in a collection. A `for` loop looks like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```

If we run this, we'll see the same output as the previous example. Importantly,
though, we've now increased the safety of our code and eliminated the chance of
bugs resulting from going beyond the end of the array or not going far enough
and missing some items.

For example, in the previous code that uses the `while` loop, if we removed an
item from the `a` array but forgot to update the condition to be `while index <
4`, our code would panic. Using the `for` loop means we would not need to
remember to change any other code if we changed the the number of values in the
array.

If you're wondering about the `.iter()` code in this example, keep reading! We
will cover method syntax generally in Chapter XX and iterators specifically in
Chapter XX. For now, though, let's get into the concept of ownership.
