## Variables and Mutability

As mentioned in Chapter 2, by default variables are *immutable*. This is one of
many nudges in Rust that encourages you to write your code in a way that takes
advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers. However, you
still have the option to make your variables mutable. Let’s explore how and why
Rust encourages you to favor immutability, and why you might want to opt out.

When a variable is immutable, that means mean once a value is bound to a name,
you can’t change that value. To illustrate, let’s generate a new project called
*variables* in your *projects* directory by using `cargo new --bin variables`.

Then, in your new *variables* directory, open *src/main.rs* and replace its
code with the following:

<span class=“filename”>Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Save and run the program using `cargo run`. You should receive an error
message, as shown in this output:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.0.1 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ re-assignment of immutable variable
```

This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.
Even though compiler errors can be frustrating, they only mean your program
isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do *not* mean that you’re
not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors. The
error indicates that the cause of the error is `re-assignment of immutable
variable`, because we tried to assign a second value to the immutable `x`
variable.

It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that we previously designated as immutable because this very situation
can lead to bugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a
value will never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s
possible that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do.
This cause of bugs can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code changes the value only *sometimes*.

In Rust the compiler guarantees that when we state that a value won’t change,
it really won’t change. That means that when you’re reading and writing code,
you don’t have to keep track of how and where a value might change, which can
make code easier to reason about.

But mutability can be very useful. Variables are immutable only by default; we
can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name. In
addition to allowing this value to change, it conveys intent to future readers
of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this
variable value.

For example, change *src/main.rs* to the following:

<span class=“filename”>Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

When we run this program, we get the following:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```

Using `mut`, we’re allowed to change the value that `x` binds to from `5` to
`6`. In some cases, you’ll want to make a variable mutable because it makes the
code more convenient to write than an implementation that only uses immutable
variables.

There are multiple trade-offs to consider, in addition to the prevention of
bugs. For example, in cases where you’re using large data structures, mutating
an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated
instances. With smaller data structures, always creating new instances and
writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to reason about,
so the lower performance penalty might be worth it to gain that clarity.

### Differences Between Variables and Constants

Not being able to change the value of a variable might have reminded you of
another programming concept that most languages have: *constants*. Constants
are also values bound to a name that are not allowed to change, but there are a
few differences between constants and variables. First, using `mut` with
constants is not allowed: constants aren’t only immutable by default, they’re
always immutable. Constants are declared using the `const` keyword instead of
the `let` keyword, and the type of the value *must* be annotated. We’re about
to cover types and type annotations in the next section, “Data Types,” so don’t
worry about the details right now. Constants can be declared in any scope,
including the global scope, which makes them useful for a value that many parts
of your code need to know about. The last difference is that constants may only
be set to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other
value that could only be used at runtime.

Here’s an example of a constant declaration where the constant’s name is
`MAX_POINTS` and its value is set to 100,000. Rust constant naming convention
is to use all upper case with underscores between words:

```
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

Constants are valid for the entire lifetime of a program, within the scope they
were declared in. That makes constants useful for values in your application
domain that multiple part of the program might need to know about, such as the
maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn or the number
of seconds in a year.

Documenting hardcoded values used throughout your program by naming them as
constants is useful to convey the meaning of that value to future maintainers
of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code that you would
need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.

### Shadowing

As we saw in the guessing game tutorial in Chapter 2, we can declare new
variables with the same name as a previous variables, and the new variable
*shadows* the previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is
*shadowed* by the second, which means that the second variable’s value is what
we’ll see when we use the variable. We can shadow a variable by using the same
variable’s name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword as follows:

<span class=“filename”>Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then it shadows `x` by
repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so the value of
`x` is then `6`. The third `let` statement also shadows `x`, taking the
previous value and multiplying it by `2` to give `x` a final value of `12`.
When you run this program, it will output the following:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 12
```

This is different than marking a variable as `mut`, because unless we use the
`let` keyword again, we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to
reassign to this variable. We can perform a few transformations on a value but
have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re
effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can
change the type of the value, but reuse the same name. For example, say our
program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by
inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:

```rust
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

This construct is allowed because the first `spaces` variable is a string type,
and the second `spaces` variable, which is a brand-new variable that happens to
have the same name as the first one, is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us
from having to come up with different names, like `spaces_str` and
`spaces_num`; instead, we can reuse the simpler `spaces` name. However, if we
try to use `mut` for this, as shown here:

```rust,ignore
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```

we’ll get a compile-time error because we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s
type:

```text
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:3:14
  |
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected &str, found usize
  |
  = note: expected type `&str`
  = note:    found type `usize`
```

Now that we’ve explored how variables work, let’s look at more data types they
can have.
