# Common Programming Concepts in Rust

Let's first look at concepts that appear in almost every programming language and see
how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at their
core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust, but
we’ll discuss Rust’s particular syntax and conventions concerning these common
concepts.

Specifically, we’ll be talking about variable bindings, basic types, functions,
comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust
program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.

Keep in mind as we get into variables and functions that the Rust language has
a set of *keywords* that have been reserved for use by the language only, much
like other languages do. This means you cannot use these words as names of
variables or functions, for example. Most of these have special meaning and we
will be using them to do various things in our Rust programs; a few have no
current functionality associated but have been reserved for functionality that
might be in the Rust language in the future. You can find a list of the
keywords in Appendix XX.
