## Operators

### Unary operator expressions

Rust defines the following unary operators. They are all written as prefix
operators, before the expression they apply to.

* `-`
  : Negation. Signed integer types and floating-point types support negation. It
    is an error to apply negation to unsigned types; for example, the compiler
    rejects `-1u32`.
* `*`
  : Dereference. When applied to a pointer, it denotes the pointed-to location.
    For pointers to mutable locations, the resulting value can be assigned to.
    On non-pointer types, it calls the `deref` method of the `std::ops::Deref`
    trait, or the `deref_mut` method of the `std::ops::DerefMut` trait (if
    implemented by the type and required for an outer expression that will or
    could mutate the dereference), and produces the result of dereferencing the
    `&` or `&mut` borrowed pointer returned from the overload method.
* `!`
  : Logical negation. On the boolean type, this flips between `true` and
    `false`. On integer types, this inverts the individual bits in the
    two’s complement representation of the value.
* `&` and `&mut`
  : Borrowing. When applied to a value, these operators produce a
    reference (pointer) to that value. The value is also placed into
    a borrowed state for the duration of the reference. For a shared
    borrow (`&`), this implies that the value may not be mutated, but
    it may be read or shared again. For a mutable borrow (`&mut`), the
    value may not be accessed in any way until the borrow expires.

### Binary operator expressions

Binary operators expressions are given in order of operator precedence.

#### Arithmetic operators

Binary arithmetic expressions are syntactic sugar for calls to built-in traits,
defined in the `std::ops` module of the `std` library. This means arithmetic
operators can be overridden for user-defined types. The default meaning of the
operators on standard types is given here.

* `+`
  : Addition and array/string concatenation.
    Calls the `add` method on the `std::ops::Add` trait.
* `-`
  : Subtraction.
    Calls the `sub` method on the `std::ops::Sub` trait.
* `*`
  : Multiplication.
    Calls the `mul` method on the `std::ops::Mul` trait.
* `/`
  : Quotient.
    Calls the `div` method on the `std::ops::Div` trait.
* `%`
  : Remainder.
    Calls the `rem` method on the `std::ops::Rem` trait.

Note that Rust does not have a built-in operator for exponential (power)
calculation; see the `pow` method on the numeric types.

#### Bitwise operators

Like the arithmetic operators, bitwise operators are syntactic sugar for calls
to methods of built-in traits. This means bitwise operators can be overridden
for user-defined types. The default meaning of the operators on standard types
is given here. Bitwise `&`, `|` and `^` applied to boolean arguments are
equivalent to logical `&&`, `||` and `!=` evaluated in non-lazy fashion.

* `&`
  : Bitwise AND.
    Calls the `bitand` method of the `std::ops::BitAnd` trait.
* `|`
  : Bitwise inclusive OR.
    Calls the `bitor` method of the `std::ops::BitOr` trait.
* `^`
  : Bitwise exclusive OR.
    Calls the `bitxor` method of the `std::ops::BitXor` trait.
* `<<`
  : Left shift.
    Calls the `shl` method of the `std::ops::Shl` trait.
* `>>`
  : Right shift (arithmetic).
    Calls the `shr` method of the `std::ops::Shr` trait.

#### Lazy boolean operators

The operators `||` and `&&` may be applied to operands of boolean type. The
`||` operator denotes logical ‘or’, and the `&&` operator denotes logical
‘and’. They differ from `|` and `&` in that the right-hand operand is only
evaluated when the left-hand operand does not already determine the result of
the expression. That is, `||` only evaluates its right-hand operand when the
left-hand operand evaluates to `false`, and `&&` only when it evaluates to
`true`.

#### Comparison operators

Comparison operators are, like the arithmetic operators and bitwise operators,
syntactic sugar for calls to built-in traits. This means that comparison
operators can be overridden for user-defined types. The default meaning of the
operators on standard types is given here.

* `==`
  : Equal to.
    Calls the `eq` method on the `std::cmp::PartialEq` trait.
* `!=`
  : Unequal to.
    Calls the `ne` method on the `std::cmp::PartialEq` trait.
* `<`
  : Less than.
    Calls the `lt` method on the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait.
* `>`
  : Greater than.
    Calls the `gt` method on the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait.
* `<=`
  : Less than or equal.
    Calls the `le` method on the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait.
* `>=`
  : Greater than or equal.
    Calls the `ge` method on the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait.

#### Type cast expressions

A type cast expression is denoted with the binary operator `as`.

Executing an `as` expression casts the value on the left-hand side to the type
on the right-hand side.

An example of an `as` expression:

```rust
# fn sum(values: &[f64]) -> f64 { 0.0 }
# fn len(values: &[f64]) -> i32 { 0 }

fn average(values: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    let sum: f64 = sum(values);
    let size: f64 = len(values) as f64;
    sum / size
}
```

Some of the conversions which can be done through the `as` operator
can also be done implicitly at various points in the program, such as
argument passing and assignment to a `let` binding with an explicit
type. Implicit conversions are limited to “harmless” conversions that
do not lose information and which have minimal or no risk of
surprising side-effects on the dynamic execution semantics.

#### Assignment expressions

An *assignment expression* consists of a pattern followed by an equals
sign (`=`) and an expression.

Evaluating an assignment expression either copies or
moves its right-hand operand to its left-hand
operand.

```
# let mut x = 0;
# let y = 0;
x = y;
```

#### Compound assignment expressions

The `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, and `>>` operators may be
composed with the `=` operator. The expression `lval OP= val` is equivalent to
`lval = lval OP val`. For example, `x = x + 1` may be written as `x += 1`.

Any such expression always has the `unit` type.

#### Operator precedence

The precedence of Rust binary operators is ordered as follows, going from
strong to weak:

```text
as :
* / %
+ -
<< >>
&
^
|
== != < > <= >=
&&
||
.. ...
<-
=
```

Operators at the same precedence level are evaluated left-to-right. Unary
operators have the same precedence level and are stronger than any of the
binary operators.
