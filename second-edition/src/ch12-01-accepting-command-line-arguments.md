## Accepting Command Line Arguments

Let’s create a new project with, as always, `cargo new`. We’re calling our
project `minigrep` to distinguish from the `grep` tool that you may already
have on your system:

```text
$ cargo new --bin minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
```

Our first task is to make `minigrep` able to accept its two command line
arguments: the filename and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able
to run our program with `cargo run`, a string to search for, and a path to a
file to search in, like so:

```text
$ cargo run searchstring example-filename.txt
```

Right now, the program generated by `cargo new` cannot process arguments we
give it. There are some existing libraries on crates.io that can help us accept
command line arguments, but since you’re learning, let’s implement this
ourselves.

### Reading the Argument Values

We first need to make sure our program is able to get the values of command
line arguments we pass to it, for which we’ll need a function provided in
Rust’s standard library: `std::env::args`. This function returns an *iterator*
of the command line arguments that were given to our program. We haven’t
discussed iterators yet, and we’ll cover them fully in Chapter 13, but for our
purposes now we only need to know two things about iterators: Iterators produce
a series of values, and we can call the `collect` function on an iterator to
turn it into a collection, such as a vector, containing all of the elements the
iterator produces.

Let’s give it a try: use the code in Listing 12-1 to allow your `minigrep`
program to read any command line arguments passed it and then collect the
values into a vector.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```

Listing 12-1: Collect the command line arguments into a vector and print them
out

First, we bring the `std::env` module into scope with a `use` statement so that
we can use its `args` function. Notice the `std::env::args` function is nested
in two levels of modules. As we talked about in Chapter 7, in cases where the
desired function is nested in more than one module, it’s conventional to bring
the parent module into scope, rather than the function itself. This lets us
easily use other functions from `std::env`. It’s also less ambiguous than
adding `use std::env::args;` then calling the function with just `args`; that
might easily be mistaken for a function that’s defined in the current module.

On the first line of `main`, we call `env::args`, and immediately use `collect`
to turn the iterator into a vector containing all of the values produced by the
iterator. The `collect` function can be used to create many kinds of
collections, so we explicitly annotate the type of `args` to specify that we
want a vector of strings. Though we very rarely need to annotate types in Rust,
`collect` is one function you do often need to annotate because Rust isn’t able
to infer what kind of collection you want.

Finally, we print out the vector with the debug formatter, `:?`. Let’s try
running our code with no arguments, and then with two arguments:

```text
$ cargo run
["target/debug/minigrep"]

$ cargo run needle haystack
...snip...
["target/debug/minigrep", "needle", "haystack"]
```

You may notice that the first value in the vector is `"target/debug/minigrep"`,
which is the name of our binary. This matches the behavior of the arguments
list in C, and lets programs use the name by which they were invoked in their
execution. It’s convenient to have access to the program name in case we want
to print it in messages or change behavior of the program based on what command
line alias was used to invoke the program, but for the purposes of this chapter
we’re going to ignore it and only save the two arguments we need.

### Saving the Argument Values in Variables

Printing out the value of the vector of arguments has illustrated that the
program is able to access the values specified as command line arguments. Now
we need to save the values of the two arguments in variables so that we can use
the values throughout the rest of the program. Let’s do that as shown in
Listing 12-2:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust,should_panic
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let query = &args[1];
    let filename = &args[2];

    println!("Searching for {}", query);
    println!("In file {}", filename);
}
```

Listing 12-2: Create variables to hold the query argument and filename argument

As we saw when we printed out the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at `args[0]`, so that we’re starting at index `1`. The
first argument `minigrep` takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable `query`. The second argument
will be the filename, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable `filename`.

We’re temporarily printing out the values of these variables, again to prove to
ourselves that our code is working as we intend. Let’s try running this program
again with the arguments `test` and `sample.txt`:

```text
$ cargo run test sample.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep test sample.txt`
Searching for test
In file sample.txt
```

Great, it’s working! The values of the arguments we need are being saved into
the right variables. Let's read the contents of the file specified next.
