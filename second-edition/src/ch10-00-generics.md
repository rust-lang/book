# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

Every programming language has tools to deal effectively with duplication of
concepts; in Rust, one of those tools is *generics*. Generics are abstract
stand-ins for concrete types or other properties. We can express properties of
generics, such as their behavior or how they relate to other generics, without
needing to know when we're writing and compiling the code what will actually be
in their place.

In the same way that a function takes parameters whose value we don't know in
order to write code once that will be run on multiple concrete values, we can
write functions that take parameters of some generic type instead of a concrete
type like `i32` or `String`. We've already used generics in Chapter 6 with
`Option<T>`, Chapter 8 with `Vec<T>` and `HashMap<K, V>`, and Chapter 9 with
`Result<T, E>`. In this chapter, we'll explore how to define our own types,
functions, and methods with generics!

First, we're going to review the mechanics of extracting a function that
reduces code duplication. Then we'll use the same mechanics to make a generic
function out of two functions that only differ in the types of their
parameters. We'll go over using generic types in struct and enum definitions
too.

After that, we'll discuss *traits*, which are a way to define behavior in a
generic way. Traits can be combined with generic types in order to constrain a
generic type to those types that have a particular behavior, rather than any
type at all.

Finally, we'll discuss *lifetimes*, which are a kind of generic that let us
give the compiler information about how references are related to each other.
Lifetimes are the feature in Rust that allow us to borrow values in many
situations and still have the compiler check that references will be valid.

## Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function

Before getting into generics syntax, let's first review a technique for dealing
with duplication that doesn't use generic types: extracting a function. While
that's fresh in our minds, we'll use the same mechanics with generics to extract
a generic function! In the same way that you recognize duplicated code to
extract into a function, you'll start to recognize duplicated code that can use
generics.

Consider a small program that finds the largest number in a list, shown in
Listing 10-1:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = numbers[0];

    for number in numbers {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
#  assert_eq!(largest, 100);
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 10-1: Code to find the largest number in a list
of numbers</span>

This code begins with a list of integers in the variable `numbers`.  It stores
the first number in the list in the variable named `largest`.  Then it iterates
through all the numbers in the list. If the current number is greater than the
number stored in `largest`, it replaces the number in `largest`.  If the current
number is smaller than the number stored in `largest`, nothing is changed.  When
all the numbers in the list have been considered, `largest` will hold the
largest number, which in this case is 100.

If we needed to find the largest number in two different lists of numbers, we
could duplicate the code in Listing 10-1 and have the same logic exist in two
places in the program, as in Listing 10-2:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = numbers[0];

    for number in numbers {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);

    let numbers = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let mut largest = numbers[0];

    for number in numbers {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 10-2: Code to find the largest number in *two*
lists of numbers</span>

While this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error-prone, and means
we have multiple places to update the logic if we need to change it.

<!-- Are we safe assuming the reader will be familiar with the term
"abstraction" in this context, or do we want to give a brief definition? -->
<!-- Yes, our audience will be familiar with this term. /Carol -->

To eliminate this duplication, we can create an abstraction, which in this case
will be in the form of a function that operates on any list of integers given
to the function in a parameter. This will increase the clarity of our code and
let us communicate and reason about the concept of finding the largest number
in a list independently of the specific places this concept is used.

In the program in Listing 10-3, we've extracted the code that finds the largest
number into a function named `largest`. This program can find the largest
number in two different lists of numbers, but the code from Listing 10-1 only
exists in one spot:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&numbers);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
#    assert_eq!(result, 100);

    let numbers = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let result = largest(&numbers);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
#    assert_eq!(result, 6000);
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 10-3: Abstracted code to find the largest number
in two lists</span>

The function has a parameter, `list`, which represents any concrete slice of
`i32` values that we might pass into the function. The code in the function
definition operates on the `list` representation of any `&[i32]`. When we call
the `largest` function, the code actually runs on the specific values that we
pass in.

The mechanics we went through to get from Listing 10-2 to Listing 10-3 were
these steps:

1. We noticed there was duplicate code.
2. We extracted the duplicate code into the body of the function, and specified
   the inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.
3. We replaced the two concrete places that had the duplicated code to call the
   function instead.

We can use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication in
different ways in different scenarios. In the same way that the function body
is now operating on an abstract `list` instead of concrete values, code using
generics will operate on abstract types. The concepts powering generics are the
same concepts you already know that power functions, just applied in different
ways.

What if we had two functions, one that found the largest item in a slice of
`i32` values and one that found the largest item in a slice of `char` values?
How would we get rid of that duplication? Let's find out!
