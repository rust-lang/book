## `RefCell<T>` and the Interior Mutability Pattern

<!-- I'm concerned here about referencing forward too much, do we need that
information from Ch 19 to understand this? Should we look at rearranging a few
things here? -->
<!-- We don't think the reader needs to *understand* `unsafe` at this point,
just that `unsafe` is how this is possible and that we'll learn about `unsafe`
later. After reading this section, did you feel that you needed to know more
about `unsafe` to understand this section? /Carol -->

<!--below: as in, we use the pattern, or it's used automatically? I'm not clear
on what's the user's responsibility with this pattern -->
<!-- When we choose to use types implemented using the interior mutability
pattern, or when we implement our own types using the interior mutability
pattern. /Carol -->

*Interior mutability* is a design pattern in Rust for allowing you to mutate
data even when there are immutable references to that data, normally disallowed
by the borrowing rules. To do so, the pattern uses `unsafe` code inside a data
structure to bend Rust’s usual rules around mutation and borrowing. We haven’t
yet covered unsafe code; we will in Chapter 19. We can choose to use types that
make use of the interior mutability pattern when we can ensure that the
borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the compiler can’t
ensure that. The `unsafe` code involved is then wrapped in a safe API, and the
outer type is still immutable.

Let’s explore this by looking at the `RefCell<T>` type that follows the
interior mutability pattern.

### Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime with `RefCell<T>`

Unlike `Rc<T>`, the `RefCell<T>` type represents single ownership over the data
it holds. So, what makes `RefCell<T>` different than a type like `Box<T>`?
Let’s recall the borrowing rules we learned in Chapter 4:

1. At any given time, you can have *either* but not both of:
  * One mutable reference.
  * Any number of immutable references.
2. References must always be valid.

With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules’ invariants are enforced at
compile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced *at runtime*.
With references, if you break these rules, you’ll get a compiler error. With
`RefCell<T>`, if you break these rules, you’ll get a `panic!`.

<!-- Is there an advantage to having these rules enforced at different times?
-->
<!-- Yes, that's what we were trying to say below, we've tried to make this more explicit /Carol -->

The advantages to checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors
will be caught sooner in the development process and there is no impact on
runtime performance since all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those
reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice for
the majority of cases, which is why this is Rust’s default.

The advantage to checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that
certain memory safe scenarios are then allowed, whereas they are disallowed by
the compile time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler, is inherently
conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by analyzing the
code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is out of scope of
this book but an interesting topic to research if you’re interested.

<!--below: can't be sure of what, exactly? Sure that the code complies with the
ownership rules? -->
<!-- Yes /Carol -->

Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can’t be sure the
code complies with the ownership rules, it may reject a correct program; in
this way, it is conservative. If Rust were to accept an incorrect program,
users would not be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust
rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing
catastrophic can occur. `RefCell<T>` is useful when you yourself are sure that
your code follows the borrowing rules, but the compiler is not able to
understand and guarantee that.

Similarly to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios
and will give you a compile time error if you try in a multithreaded context.
We’ll talk about how to get the functionality of `RefCell<T>` in a
multithreaded program in Chapter 16.

<!-- I'm not really clear at this point what the difference between Rc<T> and
RefCell<T> is, perhaps a succinct round up would help? -->
<!-- Done /Carol -->

To recap the reasons to choose `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, or `RefCell<T>`:

- `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>`
  have single owners.
- `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>`
  only allows immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows
  immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, we can mutate
  the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is itself
  immutable.

The last reason is the *interior mutability* pattern. Let’s look at a case when
interior mutability is useful and discuss how this is possible.

### Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value

A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when we have an immutable value,
we can’t borrow it mutably. For example, this code won’t compile:

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &mut x;
}
```

If we try to compile this, we’ll get this error:

```text
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable local variable `x` as mutable
 --> src/main.rs:3:18
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - consider changing this to `mut x`
3 |     let y = &mut x;
  |                  ^ cannot borrow mutably
```

However, there are situations where it would be useful for a value to be able
to mutate itself in its methods, but to other code, the value would appear to
be immutable. Code outside the value’s methods would not be able to mutate the
value. `RefCell<T>` is one way to get the ability to have interior mutability.
`RefCell<T>` isn’t getting around the borrowing rules completely, but the
borrow checker in the compiler allows this interior mutability and the
borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead. If we violate the rules, we’ll
get a `panic!` instead of a compiler error.

Let’s work through a practical example where we can use `RefCell<T>` to make it
possible to mutate an immutable value and see why that’s useful.

#### A Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects

A *test double* is the general programming concept for a type that stands in
the place of another type during testing. *Mock objects* are specific types of
test doubles that record what happens during a test so that we can assert that
the correct actions took place.

While Rust doesn’t have objects in the exact same sense that other languages
have objects, and Rust doesn’t have mock object functionality built into the
standard library like some other languages do, we can definitely create a
struct that will serve the same purposes as a mock object.

Here’s the scenario we’d like to test: we’re creating a library that tracks a
value against a maximum value, and sends messages based on how close to the
maximum value the current value is. This could be used for keeping track of a
user’s quota for the number of API calls they’re allowed to make, for example.

Our library is only going to provide the functionality of tracking how close to
the maximum a value is, and what the messages should be at what times.
Applications that use our library will be expected to provide the actual
mechanism for sending the messages: the application could choose to put a
message in the application, send an email, send a text message, or something
else. Our library doesn’t need to know about that detail; all it needs is
something that implements a trait we’ll provide called `Messenger`. [Listing 15-23][Listing-15-23]
shows our library code:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

[Listing-15-23]: #Listing-15-23
<a name="Listing-15-23"></a>

```rust
pub trait Messenger {
    fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}

pub struct LimitTracker<'a, T: 'a + Messenger> {
    messenger: &'a T,
    value: usize,
    max: usize,
}

impl<'a, T> LimitTracker<'a, T>
    where T: Messenger {
    pub fn new(messenger: &T, max: usize) -> LimitTracker<T> {
        LimitTracker {
            messenger,
            value: 0,
            max,
        }
    }

    pub fn set_value(&mut self, value: usize) {
        self.value = value;

        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;

        if percentage_of_max >= 0.75 && percentage_of_max < 0.9 {
            self.messenger.send("Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.9 && percentage_of_max < 1.0 {
            self.messenger.send("Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!");
        } else if percentage_of_max >= 1.0 {
            self.messenger.send("Error: You are over your quota!");
        }
    }
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-23: A library to keep track of how close to a
maximum value a value is, and warn when the value is at certain levels</span>

One important part of this code is that the `Messenger` trait has one method,
`send`, that takes an immutable reference to `self` and text of the message.
This is the interface our mock object will need to have. The other important
part is that we want to test the behavior of the `set_value` method on the
`LimitTracker`. We can change what we pass in for the `value` parameter, but
`set_value` doesn’t return anything for us to make assertions on. What we want
to be able to say is that if we create a `LimitTracker` with something that
implements the `Messenger` trait and a particular value for `max`, when we pass
different numbers for `value`, the messenger gets told to send the appropriate
messages.

What we need is a mock object that, instead of actually sending an email or
text message when we call `send`, will only keep track of the messages it’s
told to send. We can create a new instance of the mock object, create a
`LimitTracker` that uses the mock object, call the `set_value` method on
`LimitTracker`, then check that the mock object has the messages we expect.
[Listing 15-24][Listing-15-24] shows an attempt of implementing a mock object to do just that,
but that the borrow checker won’t allow:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

[Listing-15-24]: #Listing-15-24
<a name="Listing-15-24"></a>

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    struct MockMessenger {
        sent_messages: Vec<String>,
    }

    impl MockMessenger {
        fn new() -> MockMessenger {
            MockMessenger { sent_messages: vec![] }
        }
    }

    impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }

    #[test]
    fn it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
        let mock_messenger = MockMessenger::new();
        let mut limit_tracker = LimitTracker::new(&mock_messenger, 100);

        limit_tracker.set_value(80);

        assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.len(), 1);
    }
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-24: An attempt to implement a `MockMessenger`
that isn’t allowed by the borrow checker</span>

This test code defines a `MockMessenger` struct that has a `sent_messages`
field with a `Vec` of `String` values to keep track of the messages it’s told
to send. We also defined an associated function `new` to make it convenient to
create new `MockMessenger` values that start with an empty list of messages. We
then implement the `Messenger` trait for `MockMessenger` so that we can give a
`MockMessenger` to a `LimitTracker`. In the definition of the `send` method, we
take the message passed in as a parameter and store it in the `MockMessenger`
list of `sent_messages`.

In the test, we’re testing what happens when the `LimitTracker` is told to set
`value` to something that’s over 75% of the `max` value. First, we create a new
`MockMessenger`, which will start with an empty list of messages. Then we
create a new `LimitTracker` and give it a reference to the new `MockMessenger`
and a `max` value of 100. We call the `set_value` method on the `LimitTracker`
with a value of 80, which is more than 75% of 100. Then we assert that the list
of messages that the `MockMessenger` is keeping track of should now have one
message in it.

There’s one problem with this test, however:

```text
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable field `self.sent_messages` as mutable
  --> src/lib.rs:46:13
   |
45 |         fn send(&self, message: &str) {
   |                 ----- use `&mut self` here to make mutable
46 |             self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot mutably borrow immutable field
```

We can’t modify the `MockMessenger` to keep track of the messages because the
`send` method takes an immutable reference to `self`. We also can’t take the
suggestion from the error text to use `&mut self` instead because then the
signature of `send` wouldn’t match the signature in the `Messenger` trait
definition (feel free to try and see what error message you get).

This is where interior mutability can help! We’re going to store the
`sent_messages` within a `RefCell`, and then the `send` message will be able to
modify `sent_messages` to store the messages we’ve seen. [Listing 15-25][Listing-15-25] shows
what that looks like:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

[Listing-15-25]: #Listing-15-25

```rust

    }

    impl MockMessenger {
        fn new() -> MockMessenger {
            MockMessenger { sent_messages: RefCell::new(vec![]) }
        }
    }

    impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
        }
    }

    #[test]

        assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.borrow().len(), 1);
    }
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-25: Using `RefCell<T>` to be able to mutate an
inner value while the outer value is considered immutable</span>

The `sent_messages` field is now of type `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instead of
`Vec<String>`. In the `new` function, we create a new `RefCell` instance around
the empty vector.

For the implementation of the `send` method, the first parameter is still an
immutable borrow of `self`, which matches the trait definition. We call
`borrow_mut` on the `RefCell` in `self.sent_messages` to get a mutable
reference to the value inside the `RefCell`, which is the vector. Then we can
call `push` on the mutable reference to the vector in order to keep track of
the messages seen during the test.

The last change we have to make is in the assertion: in order to see how many
items are in the inner vector, we call `borrow` on the `RefCell` to get an
immutable reference to the vector.

Now that we’ve seen how to use `RefCell<T>`, let’s dig into how it works!

#### `RefCell<T>` Keeps Track of Borrows at Runtime

When creating immutable and mutable references we use the `&` and `&mut`
syntax, respectively. With `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow` and `borrow_mut`
methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to `RefCell<T>`. The
`borrow` method returns the smart pointer type `Ref`, and `borrow_mut` returns
the smart pointer type `RefMut`. Both types implement `Deref` so we can treat
them like regular references.

<!-- can you clarify what you mean, practically, by "track borrows
dynamically"?-->
<!-- Yep, we've tried to clarify in the next paragraph. /Carol -->

The `RefCell<T>` keeps track of how many `Ref` and `RefMut` smart pointers are
currently active. Every time we call `borrow`, the `RefCell<T>` increases its
count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a `Ref` value goes out of
scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one. Just like the compile
time borrowing rules, `RefCell<T>` lets us have many immutable borrows or one
mutable borrow at any point in time.

If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error like we
would with references, the implementation of `RefCell<T>` will `panic!` at
runtime. [Listing 15-26][Listing-15-26] shows a modification to the implementation of `send`
from [Listing 15-25][Listing-15-25] where we’re deliberately trying to create two mutable
borrows active for the same scope in order to illustrate that `RefCell<T>`
prevents us from doing this at runtime:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

[Listing-15-26]: #Listing-15-26
<a name="Listing-15-26"></a>

```rust,ignore
impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
        let mut one_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();
        let mut two_borrow = self.sent_messages.borrow_mut();

        one_borrow.push(String::from(message));
        two_borrow.push(String::from(message));
    }
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-26: Creating two mutable references in the
same scope to see that `RefCell<T>` will panic</span>

We create a variable `one_borrow` for the `RefMut` smart pointer returned from
`borrow_mut`. Then we create another mutable borrow in the same way in the
variable `two_borrow`. This makes two mutable references in the same scope,
which isn’t allowed. If we run the tests for our library, this code will
compile without any errors, but the test will fail:

```text
---- tests::it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message stdout ----
	thread 'tests::it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message' panicked at
    'already borrowed: BorrowMutError', src/libcore/result.rs:906:4
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

We can see that the code panicked with the message `already borrowed:
BorrowMutError`. This is how `RefCell<T>` handles violations of the borrowing
rules at runtime.

Catching borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time means that we’d
find out that we made a mistake in our code later in the development process--
and possibly not even until our code was deployed to production. There’s also a
small runtime performance penalty our code will incur as a result of keeping
track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time. However, using
`RefCell` made it possible for us to write a mock object that can modify itself
to keep track of the messages it has seen while we’re using it in a context
where only immutable values are allowed. We can choose to use `RefCell<T>`
despite its tradeoffs to get more abilities than regular references give us.

### Having Multiple Owners of Mutable Data by Combining `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`

A common way to use `RefCell<T>` is in combination with `Rc<T>`. Recall that
`Rc<T>` lets us have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives us
immutable access to that data. If we have an `Rc<T>` that holds a `RefCell<T>`,
then we can get a value that can have multiple owners *and* that we can mutate!

<!-- maybe just recap on why we'd want that? -->
<!-- done, below /Carol -->

For example, recall the cons list example from [Listing 15-13][Listing-15-13] where we used
`Rc<T>` to let us have multiple lists share ownership of another list. Because
`Rc<T>` only holds immutable values, we aren’t able to change any of the values
in the list once we’ve created them. Let’s add in `RefCell<T>` to get the
ability to change the values in the lists. [Listing 15-27][Listing-15-27] shows that by using a
`RefCell<T>` in the `Cons` definition, we’re allowed to modify the value stored
in all the lists:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

[Listing-15-27]: #Listing-15-27
<a name="Listing-15-27"></a>

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(Rc<RefCell<i32>>, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(Rc::clone(&value), Rc::new(Nil)));

    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(6)), Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(10)), Rc::clone(&a));

    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;

    println!("a after = {:?}", a);
    println!("b after = {:?}", b);
    println!("c after = {:?}", c);
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 15-27: Using `Rc<RefCell<i32>>` to create a
`List` that we can mutate</span>

We create a value that’s an instance of `Rc<RefCell<i32>` and store it in a
variable named `value` so we can access it directly later. Then we create a
`List` in `a` with a `Cons` variant that holds `value`. We need to clone
`value` so that both `a` and `value` have ownership of the inner `5` value,
rather than transferring ownership from `value` to `a` or having `a` borrow
from `value`.

<!-- above: so that `value` has ownership of what, in addition to a? I didn't
follow the final sentence above -->
<!-- Of the inner value, I've tried to clarify /Carol -->

We wrap the list `a` in an `Rc<T>` so that when we create lists `b` and
`c`, they can both refer to `a`, the same as we did in [Listing 15-13][Listing-15-13].

Once we have the lists in `a`, `b`, and `c` created, we add 10 to the value in
`value`. We do this by calling `borrow_mut` on `value`, which uses the
automatic dereferencing feature we discussed in Chapter 5 (“Where’s the `->`
Operator?”) to dereference the `Rc<T>` to the inner `RefCell<T>` value. The
`borrow_mut` method returns a `RefMut<T>` smart pointer, and we use the
dereference operator on it and change the inner value.

When we print out `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can see that they all have the modified
value of 15 rather than 5:

```text
a after = Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil)
b after = Cons(RefCell { value: 6 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
c after = Cons(RefCell { value: 10 }, Cons(RefCell { value: 15 }, Nil))
```

This is pretty neat! By using `RefCell<T>`, we have an outwardly immutable
`List`, but we can use the methods on `RefCell<T>` that provide access to its
interior mutability so we can modify our data when we need to. The runtime
checks of the borrowing rules protect us from data races, and it’s sometimes
worth trading a bit of speed for this flexibility in our data structures.

The standard library has other types that provide interior mutability, too,
like `Cell<T>`, which is similar except that instead of giving references to
the inner value, the value is copied in and out of the `Cell<T>`. There’s also
`Mutex<T>`, which offers interior mutability that’s safe to use across threads,
and we’ll be discussing its use in the next chapter on concurrency. Check out
the standard library docs for more details on the differences between these
types.
