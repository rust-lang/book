## Reading a File

We’re going to add functionality to read the file that specified in the
`filename` command line argument. First, we need a sample file to test it
with—the best kind of file to use to make sure that `minigrep` is working is
one with a small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words.
Listing 12-3 has an Emily Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file
called `poem.txt` at the root level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m
nobody! Who are you?”:

<span class="filename">Filename: poem.txt</span>

```text
I’m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
They’d banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Emily Dickinson that will make a good test case</span>

With that in place, edit *src/main.rs* and add code to open the file as shown
in Listing 12-4:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust,should_panic
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() {
#     let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
#
#     let query = &args[1];
#     let filename = &args[2];
#
#     println!("Searching for {}", query);
    // ...snip...
    println!("In file {}", filename);

    let mut f = File::open(filename).expect("file not found");

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)
        .expect("something went wrong reading the file");

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);
}
```

by the second argument</span>

First, we add some more `use` statements to bring in relevant parts of the
standard library: we need `std::fs::File` for dealing with files, and
`std::io::prelude::*` contains various traits that are useful when doing I/O,
including file I/O. In the same way that Rust has a general prelude that brings
certain things into scope automatically, the `std::io` module has its own
prelude of common things you’ll need when working with I/O. Unlike the default
prelude, we must explicitly `use` the prelude from `std::io`.

In `main`, we’ve added three things: first, we get a mutable handle to the file
by calling the `File::open` function and passing it the value of the `filename`
variable. Second, we create a variable called `contents` and set it to a
mutable, empty `String`. This will hold the content of the file after we read
it in. Third, we call `read_to_string` on our file handle and pass a mutable
reference to `contents` as an argument.

After those lines, we’ve again added a temporary `println!` statement that
prints out the value of `contents` after the file is read, so that we can check
that our program is working so far.

Let’s try running this code with any string as the first command line argument
(since we haven’t implemented the searching part yet) and our *poem.txt* file
as the second argument:

```text
$ cargo run the poem.txt
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/minigrep the poem.txt`
Searching for the
In file poem.txt
With text:
I’m nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there’s a pair of us — don’t tell!
They’d banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Great! Our code read in and printed out the content of the file. Next, let's
create a *src/lib.rs* file to hold the part of `minigrep` that will search for
the query string.
