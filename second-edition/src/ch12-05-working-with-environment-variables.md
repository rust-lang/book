## Working with Environment Variables

We're going to improve our tool with an extra feature: an option for case
insensitive searching turned on via an environment variable. We could make this
a command line option and require that users enter it each time they want it to
apply, but instead we're going to use an environment variable. This allows our
users to set the environment variable once and have all their searches be case
insensitive in that terminal session.

### Writing a Failing Test for the Case-Insensitive `search` Function

First, let's add a new function that we will call when the environment variable
is on.

<!-- You mean, to turn the environment variable on? I'm not sure what we're
doing here-->
<!-- No, I'm not sure how this is unclear. We're adding a new function. We will
call the new function when the user turns on the environment variable. Can you
elaborate on what part of the above statement leads to the conclusion that the
new function is going to turn the environment variable on? Can you suggest a
rewording that makes the causality direction clearer? /Carol -->

We're going to continue following the TDD process that we started doing in the
last section, and the first step is again to write a failing test. We'll add a
new test for the new case insensitive search function, and rename our old test
from `one_result` to `case_sensitive` to be clearer about the differences
between the two tests, as shown in Listing 12-20:

<!-- There is something satisfying about seeing the previous test name changed,
rather than just starting with a "great" name. -->

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn case_sensitive() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Duct tape.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["safe, fast, productive."],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn case_insensitive() {
        let query = "rUsT";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Trust me.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["Rust:", "Trust me."],
            search_case_insensitive(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 12-20: Adding a new failing test for the case
insensitive function we're about to add</span>

Note that we've edited the old test's `query` and `contents` too: we changed
the query to "duct", which will match the line with the word "productive".
We've added a new line with the text "Duct tape", with a capital D, that
shouldn't match the query "duct" when we're searching for the query in a case
sensitive manner. We've changed this test to ensure that we don't accidentally
break the case sensitive search functionality that we've already implemented;
this test should pass now and should continue to pass as we work on the case
insensitive search.

The new test for the case insensitive search uses "rUsT" with some capital
letters as its query. The expected return value from the
`search_case_insensitive` function we're going to add is that the query "rust"
will match both the line containing "Rust:" with a capital R and also the line
"Trust me." that contains "rust" with a lowercase r. This test will fail to
compile right now since we haven't yet defined the `search_case_insensitive`
function; feel free to add a skeleton implementation that always returns an
empty vector in the same way that we did for the `search` function in Listing
12-16 in order to see the test compile and fail.

### Implementing the `search_case_insensitive` Function

The `search_case_insensitive` function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost
the same as the `search` function. The difference is that we'll lowercase the
`query` function and each `line` so that whatever the case of the input
arguments, they will be the same case when we check whether the line contains
the query.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

```rust
fn search_case_insensitive<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let query = query.to_lowercase();
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.to_lowercase().contains(&query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 12-21: Defining the `search_case_insensitive`
function to lowercase both the query and the line before comparing them</span>

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

<!-- why do we lowercase the search string? and why does it need to be a string
rather than a slice? -->
<!-- We explained this above, that in order to make the search case
insensitive, we need to lowercase everything so that searches will always match
no matter what case either the query or each line uses. It needs to be a
`String` because we're creating new data, not referencing existing data, when
we call `to_lowercase`. I've tried to make both of these points clearer, but
I'm not sure exactly what was unclear about it before, so I'm not sure if I've
helped. /Carol -->

First, we lowercase the `query` string, and store it in a shadowed variable
with the same name. Calling `to_lowercase` on the query is necessary so that no
matter if the user's query is "rust", "RUST", "Rust", or "rUsT", we'll treat
the query as if it was "rust" and be insensitive to the case.

Note that `query` is now a `String` rather than a string slice, because calling
`to_lowercase` is creating new data, not referencing existing data. If the
query is "rUsT", that string slice does not contain a lowercase u or t for us
to use, so we have to allocate a new `String` containing "rust". Because
`query` is now a `String`, when we pass `query` as an argument to the
`contains` method, we need to add an ampersand since the signature of
`contains` is defined to take a string slice.

Next, we add a call to `to_lowercase` on each `line` before we check if it
contains `query`. This will turn "Rust:" into "rust:" and "Trust me." into
"trust me." Now that we've converted both `line` and `query` to all lowercase,
we'll find matches no matter what case the text in the file has or the user
entered in the query.

Let's see if this implementation passes the tests:

```text
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/greprs-e58e9b12d35dc861

running 2 tests
test test::case_insensitive ... ok
test test::case_sensitive ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

     Running target/debug/greprs-8a7faa2662b5030a

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests greprs

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Great! Now, let's actually call the new `search_case_insensitive` function from
the `run` function. First, we're going to add a configuration option for
switching between case sensitive and case insensitive search to the `Config`
struct:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

```rust
pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub filename: String,
    pub case_sensitive: bool,
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting in libreoffice /Carol -->

We add the `case_sensitive` field that holds a boolean. Then we need our `run`
function to check the `case_sensitive` field's value and use that to decide
whether to call the `search` function or the `search_case_insensitive` function
as shown in Listing 12-22:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

```rust
# use std::error::Error;
# use std::fs::File;
# use std::io::prelude::*;
#
# fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
#      vec![]
# }
#
# fn search_case_insensitive<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
#      vec![]
# }
#
# struct Config {
#     query: String,
#     filename: String,
#     case_sensitive: bool,
# }
#
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>>{
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    let results = if config.case_sensitive {
        search(&config.query, &contents)
    } else {
        search_case_insensitive(&config.query, &contents)
    };

    for line in results {
        println!("{}", line);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 12-22: Calling either `search` or
`search_case_insensitive` based on the value in `config.case_sensitive`</span>

<!-- Will add ghosting in libreoffice /Carol -->

Finally, we need to actually check for the environment variable. The functions
for working with environment variables are in the `env` module in the standard
library, so we want to bring that module into scope with a `use std::env;`
line at the top of *src/lib.rs*. Then we're going to use the `var` method
from the `env` module in `Config::new` to check for an environment variable
named `CASE_INSENSITIVE`, as shown in Listing 12-23:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

```rust
use std::env;
# struct Config {
#     query: String,
#     filename: String,
#     case_sensitive: bool,
# }

// ...snip...

impl Config {
    pub fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        let case_sensitive = env::var("CASE_INSENSITIVE").is_err();

        Ok(Config {
            query: query,
            filename: filename,
            case_sensitive: case_sensitive,
        })
    }
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 12-23: Checking for an environment variable named
`CASE_INSENSITIVE`</span>

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

Here, we create a new variable `case_sensitive`. In order to set its value, we
call the `env::var` function and pass it the name of the environment variable
we're looking for, `CASE_INSENSITIVE`. `env::var` returns a `Result` that will
be the `Ok` variant containing the value if the environment variable is set,
and will be the `Err` variant if the environment variable is not set. We're
using the `is_err` method on the `Result` to check to see if it's an error (and
therefore unset), which means we *should* do a case sensitive search. If the
`CASE_INSENSITIVE` environment variable is set to anything, `is_err` will
return false and we will do a case insensitive search. We don't care about the
value that the environment variable is set to, just whether it's set or unset,
so we're checking `is_err` rather than `unwrap`, `expect`, or any of the other
methods we've seen on `Result`. We pass the value in the `case_sensitive`
variable to the `Config` instance so that the `run` function can read that
value and decide whether to call `search` or `search_case_insensitive` as we
implemented in Listing 12-22.

Let's give it a try! First, we'll run our program without the environment
variable set and with the query "to", which should match any line that contains
the word "to" in all lowercase:

```text
$ cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
```

Looks like that still works! Now, let's run the program with `CASE_INSENSITIVE`
set to 1 but with the same query "to", and we should get lines that contain
"to" that might have capital letters:

```text
$ CASE_INSENSITIVE=1 cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Excellent, we also got lines containing "To"! Our `greprs` program can now do
case insensitive searching, controlled by an environment variable. Now you know
how to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment
variables!

Some programs allow both arguments *and* environment variables for the same
configuration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes
precedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case
insensitivity through a command line argument as well as through the
environment variable, and decide which should take precedence the program is
run with contradictory values.

The `std::env` module contains many more useful features for dealing with
environment variables; check out its documentation to see what's available.
