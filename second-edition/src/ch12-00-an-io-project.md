# An I/O Project Building a Small Grep

<!-- We might need a more descriptive title, something that captures the new
elements we're introducing -- are we going to cover things like environment
variables more in later chapters, or is this the only place we explain how to
use them? -->

<!-- as long as the topics only introduced here are in the table of contents,
that should be good enough? -->

<!-- This is the only place we were planning on explaining both environment
variables and printing to standard error. These are things that people commonly
want to know how to do in Rust, but there's not much more than what we've said
here about them, people just want to know how to do them in Rust. We realize
that those sections make this chapter long, but think it's worth it to include
information that people want. We've gotten really positive feedback from people
who have read this chapter online; people who like learning through projects
have really enjoyed this chapter. /Carol-->

This chapter is both a recap of the many skills you've learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features. We're going to build a
command-line tool that performs file and command line input/output to practice
some of the Rust you now have under your belt.

Rust's speed, safety, 'single binary' output, and cross-platform support make
it a good language for creating command line tools, so for our project we'll
make our own version of the classic command line tool `grep`. Grep is an
acronym for "Globally search a Regular Expression and Print." In the simplest
use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string using the
following steps:

<!-- maybe put some emphasis on the G/R/E/P in the acronym explanation? -->

- Take as arguments a filename and a string.
- Read the file.
- Find lines in the file that contain the string argument.
- Print out those lines.

We'll also show how to use environment variables and print to standard error
instead of standard out; these techniques are commonly used in command line
tools.

<!-- not to take anything away from what anyone has done, but it feels a bit
awkward calling out a specific tool by name right here...if you wanted to
mention another implementation, i'd have expected to hear about the first one
instead -->

One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a
fully-featured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`. By comparison,
our version of `grep` will be fairly simple, this chapter will give you some of
the background knowledge to help you understand a real-world project like
`ripgrep`.

This project will bring together a number of concepts you've learned so far:

- Organizing code (using what we learned in modules, Chapter 7)
- Using vectors and strings (collections, Chapter 8)
- Handling errors (Chapter 9)
- Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (Chapter 10)
- Writing tests (Chapter 11)

We'll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which
Chapters 13 and 17 will cover in detail.

Let's create a new project with, as always, `cargo new`. We're calling our
project `greprs` to distinguish from the `grep` tool that you may already have
on your system:

```text
$ cargo new --bin greprs
     Created binary (application) `greprs` project
$ cd greprs
```
