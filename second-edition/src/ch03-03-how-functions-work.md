## How Functions Work

Functions are pervasive in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most
important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry
point of many programs. You’ve also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.

Rust code uses *snake case* as the conventional style for function and variable
names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

Function definitions in Rust start with `fn` and have a set of parentheses
after the function name. The curly braces tell the compiler where the function
body begins and ends.

We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set
of parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can be
called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function`
*after* the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before
as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re
defined somewhere.

Let’s start a new binary project named *functions* to explore functions
further. Place the `another_function` example in *src/main.rs* and run it. You
should see the following output:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.
```

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the `main` function.
First, the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then `another_function` is
called and its message is printed.

### Function Parameters

Functions can also be defined to have *parameters*, which are special variables
that are part of a function's signature. When a function has parameters, we can
provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete
values are called *arguments*, but in casual conversation people tend to use
the words "parameter" and "argument" interchangeably for either the variables in
a function's definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a
function.

The following rewritten version of `another_function` shows what parameters
look like in Rust:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Try running this program; you should get the following output:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```

The declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of
`x` is specified as `i32`. When `5` is passed to `another_function`, the
`println!` macro puts `5` where the pair of curly braces were in the format
string.

In function signatures, you *must* declare the type of each parameter. This is
a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function
definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what you mean.

When you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter
declarations with commas, like this:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5, 6);
}

fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

This example creates a function with two parameters, both of which are `i32`
types. The function then prints out the values in both of its parameters. Note
that function parameters don't all need to be the same type - they just happen
to be in this example.

Let’s try running this code. Replace the program currently in your *function*
project’s *src/main.rs* file with the preceding example, and run it using
`cargo run`:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
The value of y is: 6
```

Because we called the function with `5` as the value for `x` and `6` as the
value for `y`, the two strings are printed using those values.

### Function Bodies

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an
expression. So far, we’ve only covered functions without an ending expression,
but we have seen expressions as parts of statements. Because Rust is an
expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand.
Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what
statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of
functions.

### Statements and Expressions

We’ve actually already used statements and expressions. *Statements* are
instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. *Expressions*
evaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples.

Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with the `let` keyword is a
statement. In Listing 3-3, `let y = 6;` is a statement:

<figure>
<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
```

<figcaption>

Listing 3-3: A `main` function declaration containing one statement.

</figcaption>
</figure>

Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a
statement in itself.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a `let` statement
to another variable, as the following code tries to do:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
```

When you run this program, you’ll get an error like this:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error: expected expression, found statement (`let`)
 --> src/main.rs:2:14
  |
2 |     let x = (let y = 6);
  |              ^^^
  |
  = note: variable declaration using `let` is a statement
```

The `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for
`x` to bind to. This is different than in other languages, such as C and Ruby,
where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those languages,
you can write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the value `6`; that is
not the case in Rust.

Expressions evaluate to something and make up most of the rest of the code that
you’ll write in Rust. Consider a simple math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which
is an expression that evaluates to the value `11`. Expressions can be part of
statements: in Listing 3-3 that had the statement `let y = 6;`, `6` is an
expression that evaluates to the value `6`. Calling a function is an
expression. Calling a macro is an expression. The block that we use to create
new scopes, `{}`, is an expression, for example:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

This expression:

```rust,ignore
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```

is a block that, in this case, evaluates to `4`. That value gets bound to `y`
as part of the `let` statement. Note the line without a semicolon at the end,
unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. Expressions do not include ending
semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it
into a statement, which will then not return a value. Keep this in mind as you
explore function return values and expressions next.

### Functions with Return Values

Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return
values, but we do declare their type after an arrow (`->`). In Rust, the return
value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in
the block of the body of a function. Here’s an example of a function that
returns a value:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

There are no function calls, macros, or even `let` statements in the `five`
function—just the number `5` by itself. That’s a perfectly valid function in
Rust. Note that the function’s return type is specified, too, as `-> i32`. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```

The `5` in `five` is the function’s return value, which is why the return type
is `i32`. Let’s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:
first, the line `let x = five();` shows that we’re using the return value of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function `five` returns a `5`,
that line is the same as the following:

```rust
let x = 5;
```

Second, the `five` function has no parameters and defines the type of the
return value, but the body of the function is a lonely `5` with no semicolon
because it’s an expression whose value we want to return. Let’s look at another
example:

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Running this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. What happens if we place a
semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from an
expression to a statement?

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

Running this code produces an error, as follows:

```text
error[E0269]: not all control paths return a value
 --> src/main.rs:7:1
  |
7 | fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  | ^
  |
help: consider removing this semicolon:
 --> src/main.rs:8:10
  |
8 |     x + 1;
  |          ^
```

The main error message, “not all control paths return a value,” reveals the
core issue with this code. The definition of the function `plus_one` says that
it will return an `i32`, but statements don’t evaluate to a value. Therefore,
nothing is returned, which contradicts the function definition and results in
an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to possibly help rectify this
issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which would fix the error.
