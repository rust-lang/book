# An I/O Project Building a Small Grep

<!-- We might need a more descriptive title, something that captures the new
elements we're introducing -- are we going to cover things like environment
variables more in later chapters, or is this the only place we explain how to
use them? -->

<!-- This is the only place we were planning on explaining both environment
variables and printing to standard error. These are things that people commonly
want to know how to do in Rust, but there's not much more than what we've said
here about them, people just want to know how to do them in Rust. We realize
that those sections make this chapter long, but think it's worth it to include
information that people want. We've gotten really positive feedback from people
who have read this chapter online; people who like learning through projects
have really enjoyed this chapter. /Carol-->

This chapter is both a recap of the many skills you’ve learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features. We’re going to build a
command-line tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to
practice some of the Rust you now have under your belt.

Rust’s speed, safety, ‘single binary’ output, and cross-platform support make
it a good language for creating command line tools, so for our project we’ll
make our own version of the classic command line tool `grep`. Grep is an
acronym for “Globally search a Regular Expression and Print.“ In the simplest
use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string using the
following steps:

- Take as arguments a filename and a string.
- Read the file.
- Find lines in the file that contain the string argument.
- Print out those lines.

We’ll also show how to use environment variables and print to standard error
instead of standard out; these techniques are commonly used in command line
tools.

One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a
fully-featured, very fast version of `grep`, called `ripgrep`. By comparison,
our version of `grep` will be fairly simple, this chapter will give you some of
the background knowledge to help you understand a real-world project like
`ripgrep`.

This project will bring together a number of concepts you’ve learned so far:

- Organizing code (using what we learned in modules, Chapter 7)
- Using vectors and strings (collections, Chapter 8)
- Handling errors (Chapter 9)
- Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (Chapter 10)
- Writing tests (Chapter 11)

We’ll also briefly introduce closures, iterators, and trait objects, which
Chapters 13 and 17 will cover in detail.

Let’s create a new project with, as always, `cargo new`. We’re calling our
project `greprs` to distinguish from the `grep` tool that you may already have
on your system:

```
$ cargo new --bin greprs
     Created binary (application) `greprs` project
$ cd greprs
```

## Accepting Command Line Arguments

Our first task is to make `greprs` able to accept its two command line
arguments: the filename and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able
to run our program with `cargo run`, a string to search for, and a path to a
file to search in, like so:

```
$ cargo run searchstring example-filename.txt
```

Right now, the program generated by `cargo new` ignores any arguments we give
it. There are some existing libraries on crates.io that can help us accept
command line arguments, but since we’re learning, let’s implement this
ourselves.

<!--Below -- I'm not clear what we need the args function for, yet, can you set
it out more concretely? Otherwise, will it make more sense in context of the
code later? Is this function needed to allow our function to accept arguments,
is that was "args" is for? -->
<!-- We mentioned in the intro to this chapter that grep takes as arguments a
filename and a string. I've added an example of how we want to run our
resulting tool and what we want the behavior to be, please let me know if this
doesn't clear it up. /Carol-->

### Reading the Argument Values

In order to be able to get the values of command line arguments passed to our
program, we’ll need to call a function provided in Rust’s standard library:
`std::env::args`. This function returns an *iterator* of the command line
arguments that were given to our program. We haven’t discussed iterators yet,
and we’ll cover them fully in Chapter 13, but for our purposes now we only need
to know two things about iterators:

1. Iterators produce a series of values.
2. We can call the `collect` function on an iterator to turn it into a vector
   containing all of the elements the iterator produces.

Let’s give it a try: use the code in Listing 12-1 to read any command line
arguments passed to our `greprs` program and collect them into a vector.

<!-- Give what a try, here, what are we making? Can you lay that out? I've
tried above but I'm not sure it's complete -->
<!-- We're not creating anything, we're just reading. I'm not sure if I've made
this clearer. /Carol -->

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```

Listing 12-1: Collect the command line arguments into a vector and print them
out

<!-- Will add wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

First, we bring the `std::env` module into scope with a `use` statement so that
we can use its `args` function. Notice the `std::env::args` function is nested
in two levels of modules. As we talked about in Chapter 7, in cases where the
desired function is nested in more than one module, it’s conventional to bring
the parent module into scope, rather than the function itself. This lets us
easily use other functions from `std::env`. It’s also less ambiguous than
adding `use std::env::args;` then calling the function with just `args`; that
might look like a function that’s defined in the current module.

<!-- We realized that we need to add the following caveat to fully specify
the behavior of `std::env::args` /Carol -->

<!-- PROD: START BOX -->

> Note: `std::env::args` will panic if any argument contains invalid Unicode.
> If you need to accept arguments containing invalid Unicode, use
> `std::env::args_os` instead. That function returns `OsString` values instead
> of `String` values. We’ve chosen to use `std::env::args` here for simplicity
> because `OsString` values differ per-platform and are more complex to work
> with than `String` values.

<!-- PROD: END BOX -->

<!--what is it we're making into a vector here, the arguments we pass?-->
<!-- The iterator of the arguments. /Carol -->

On the first line of `main`, we call `env::args`, and immediately use `collect`
to turn the iterator into a vector containing all of the iterator’s values. The
`collect` function can be used to create many kinds of collections, so we
explicitly annotate the type of `args` to specify that we want a vector of
strings. Though we very rarely need to annotate types in Rust, `collect` is one
function you do often need to annotate because Rust isn’t able to infer what
kind of collection you want.

Finally, we print out the vector with the debug formatter, `:?`. Let’s try
running our code with no arguments, and then with two arguments:

```
$ cargo run
["target/debug/greprs"]

$ cargo run needle haystack
...snip...
["target/debug/greprs", "needle", "haystack"]
```

<!--Below --- This initially confused me, do you mean that the argument at
index 0 is taken up by the name of the binary, so we start arguments at 1 when
setting them? It seems like it's something like that, reading on, and I've
edited as such, can you check? -->
<!-- Mentioning the indexes here seemed repetitive with the text after Listing
12-2. We're not "setting" arguments here, we're saving the value in variables.
I've hopefully cleared this up without needing to introduce repetition.
/Carol-->

You may notice that the first value in the vector is “target/debug/greprs”,
which is the name of our binary. The reasons for this are out of the scope of
this chapter, but we’ll need to remember this as we save the two arguments we
need.

### Saving the Argument Values in Variables

Printing out the value of the vector of arguments just illustrated that we’re
able to access the values specified as command line arguments from our program.
That’s not what we actually want to do, though, we want to save the values of
the two arguments in variables so that we can use the values in our program.
Let’s do that as shown in Listing 12-2:

<!-- By 'find the ones we care about' did you mean set particular arguments so
the user knows what to enter? I'm a little confused about what we are doing,
I've tried to clarify above -->
<!-- We're incrementally adding features and adding some code that helps the
reader be able to see and experience what the code is doing rather than just
taking our word for it. I've hopefully clarified below. /Carol -->

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let query = &args[1];
    let filename = &args[2];

    println!("Searching for {}", query);
    println!("In file {}", filename);
}
```

Listing 12-2: Create variables to hold the query argument and filename argument

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

As we saw when we printed out the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at `args[0]`, so we’re starting at index `1`. The first
argument `greprs` takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable `query`. The second argument
will be the filename, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable `filename`.

We’re temporarily printing out the values of these variables, again to prove to
ourselves that our code is working as we intend. Let’s try running this program
again with the arguments `test` and `sample.txt`:

```
$ cargo run test sample.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs test sample.txt`
Searching for test
In file sample.txt
```

Great, it’s working! We’re saving the values of the arguments that we need into
the right variables. Later we’ll add some error handling to deal with
situations such as when the user provides no arguments, but for now we’ll
ignore that and work on adding file reading capabilities instead.

## Reading a File

Next, we’re going to read the file that we specify in the filename command line
argument. First, we need a sample file to test it with---the best kind of file
to use to make sure that `greprs` is working is one with a small amount of text
over multiple lines with some repeated words. Listing 12-3 has an Emily
Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file called `poem.txt` at the root
level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m nobody! Who are you?“:

Filename: poem.txt

```
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us — don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Listing 12-3: The poem “I’m nobody! Who are you?“ by Emily Dickinson that will
make a good test case

<!-- Public domain Emily Dickinson poem. This will work best with something
short, but that has multiple lines and some repetition. We could search through
code; that gets a bit meta and possibly confusing... Changes to this are most
welcome. /Carol -->
<!-- :D I like it! I'm all for keeping -->
<!-- Great! /Carol -->

With that in place, edit *src/main.rs* and add code to open the file as shown
in Listing 12-4:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let query = &args[1];
    let filename = &args[2];

    println!("Searching for {}", query);
    println!("In file {}", filename);

    let mut f = File::open(filename).expect("file not found");

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents).expect("something went wrong reading the file");

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);
}
```

Listing 12-4: Reading the contents of the file specified by the second argument

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

First, we add some more `use` statements to bring in relevant parts of the
standard library: we need `std::fs::File` for dealing with files, and
`std::io::prelude::*` contains various traits that are useful when doing I/O,
including file I/O. In the same way that Rust has a general prelude that brings
certain things into scope automatically, the `std::io` module has its own
prelude of common things you’ll need when working with I/O. Unlike the default
prelude, we must explicitly `use` the prelude in `std::io`.

In `main`, we’ve added three things: first, we get a mutable handle to the file
by calling the `File::open` function and passing it the value of the `filename`
variable. Second, we create a variable called `contents` and set it to a
mutable, empty `String`. This will hold the content of the file after we read
it in. Third, we call `read_to_string` on our file handle and pass a mutable
reference to `contents` as an argument.

After those lines, we’ve again added temporary `println!` that prints out the
value in `contents` after we’ve read the file so we can check that our program
is working so far.

Let’s try running this code with any string as the first command line argument
(since we haven’t implemented the searching part yet) and our *poem.txt* file
as the second argument:

```
$ cargo run the poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs the poem.txt`
Searching for the
In file poem.txt
With text:
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us — don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Great! Our code read in and printed out the content of the file. We’ve got a
few flaws though: the `main` function has multiple responsibilities, and we’re
not handling errors as well as we could be. While our program is still small,
these flaws aren’t a big problem, but as our program grows, it will be harder
to fix them cleanly. It’s good practice to begin refactoring early on when
developing a program, as it’s much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code,
so we’ll do that now.

## Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling

There are four problems that we’d like to fix to improve our program, and they
have to do with the way the program is structured and how it’s handling
potential errors.

First, our `main` function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and
opens up files. For such a small function, this isn’t a huge problem. However,
if we keep growing our program inside of `main`, the number of separate tasks
the `main` function handles will grow. As a function gains responsibilities, it
gets harder to reason about, harder to test, and harder to change without
breaking one of its parts. It’s better to separate out functionality so that
each function is responsible for one task.

This also ties into our second problem: while `query` and `filename` are
configuration variables to our program, variables like `f` and `contents` are
used to perform our program’s logic. The longer `main` gets, the more variables
we’re going to need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope,
the harder it is to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s better to group the
configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.

The third problem is that we’ve used `expect` to print out an error message if
opening the file fails, but the error message only says `file not found`. There
are a number of ways that opening a file can fail besides a missing file: for
example, the file might exist, but we might not have permission to open it.
Right now, if we’re in that situation, we’d print the `file not found` error
message that would give the user the wrong advice!

Fourth, we use `expect` repeatedly to deal with different errors, and if the
user runs our programs without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an
“index out of bounds” error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem.
It would be better if all our error handling code was in one place so that
future maintainers only have one place to consult in the code if the error
handling logic needs to change. Having all the error handling code in one place
will also help us to ensure that we’re printing messages that will be
meaningful to our end users.

Let’s address these problems by refactoring our project.

### Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects

The organizational problem of having the `main` function responsible for
multiple tasks is common to many binary projects, so the Rust community has
developed a kind of guideline process for splitting up the separate concerns of
a binary program when `main` starts getting large. The process has the
following steps:

1. Split your program into both a *main.rs* and a *lib.rs* and move your
   program’s logic into *lib.rs*.
2. While your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in *main.rs*.
3. When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it
   from *main.rs* into *lib.rs* as well.
4. The responsibilities that remain in the `main` function after this process
   should be:
   * Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
   * Setting up any other configuration
   * Calling a `run` function in *lib.rs*
   * If `run` returns an error, handling that error

This pattern is all about separating concerns: *main.rs* handles running the
program, and *lib.rs* handles all of the logic of the task at hand. Because we
can’t test the `main` function directly, this structure lets us test all of our
program’s logic by moving it into functions in *lib.rs*. The only code that
remains in *main.rs* will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading
it. Let’s re-work our program by following this process.

<!--Since main is already handling the parsing of arguments, why do we need to
add a new function for it, can you say how that improves things? -->
<!-- Sorry, the steps we had were unclear. We've tried rewording. /Carol -->

### Extracting the Argument Parser

First, we’ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments. Listing 12-5
shows the new start of `main` that calls a new function `parse_config`, which
we’re still going to define in *src/main.rs* for the moment:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let (query, filename) = parse_config(&args);

    // ...snip...
}

fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> (&str, &str) {
    let query = &args[1];
    let filename = &args[2];

    (query, filename)
}
```

Listing 12-5: Extract a `parse_config` function from `main`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

We’re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of
assigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable `query` and the
argument value at index 2 to the variable `filename` within the `main`
function, we pass the whole vector to the `parse_config` function. The
`parse_config` function then holds the logic that knows which argument goes in
which variable, and passes the values back to `main`. We still create the
`query` and `filename` variables in `main`, but `main` no longer has the
responsibility of knowing how the command line arguments and variables
correspond.

This may seem like overkill for our small program, but we’re refactoring in
small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to
verify that the argument parsing still works. It’s good to check your progress
often, as that will help you identify the cause of problems when they occur.

#### Grouping Configuration Values

We can take another small step to improve this function further. At the moment,
we’re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that tuple up into
individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don’t have the right
abstraction yet.

Another indicator that there’s room for improvement is the `config` part of
`parse_config`, which implies that the two values we return are related and are
both part of one configuration value. We’re not currently conveying this
meaning in the structure of the data other than grouping the two values into a
tuple: we could put the two values into one struct and give each of the struct
fields a meaningful name. This will make it easier for future maintainers of
this code to understand how the different values relate to each other and what
their purpose is.

<!-- above -- I'm not sure why this is a problem --- because they aren't
currently bound together? And why does it imply that -->

> Note: some people call this anti-pattern of using primitive values when a
> complex type would be more appropriate *primitive obsession*.

<!-- Ah, I see, so the problems here stem from using simple types to do tasks
inefficiently, when a more complex task could handle it in ways that improve...
behavior? Readability? Can you say as much? -->
<!-- I've tried to clarify above. Note that when Rust programmers talk about
"efficiency", they usually mean "run-time performance", whereas here we're
talking about code design and maintainability and not addressing performance
at all. /Carol -->

Listing 12-6 shows the addition of a struct named `Config` defined to have
fields named `query` and `filename`. We’ve also changed the `parse_config`
function to return an instance of the `Config` struct, and updated `main` to
use the struct fields rather than having separate variables:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = parse_config(&args);

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    let mut f = File::open(config.filename).expect("file not found");

    // ...snip...
}

struct Config {
    query: String,
    filename: String,
}

fn parse_config(args: &[String]) -> Config {
    let query = args[1].clone();
    let filename = args[2].clone();

    Config {
        query: query,
        filename: filename,
    }
}
```

Listing 12-6: Refactoring `parse_config` to return an instance of a `Config`
struct

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

The signature of `parse_config` now indicates that it returns a `Config` value.
In the body of `parse_config`, where we used to return string slices that
reference `String` values in `args`, we’ve now chosen to define `Config` to
contain owned `String` values. The `args` variable in `main` is the owner of
the argument values and is only letting the `parse_config` function borrow
them, though, which means we’d violate Rust’s borrowing rules if `Config` tried
to take ownership of the values in `args`.

There are a number of different ways we could manage the `String` data, and the
easiest, though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the `clone` method on
the values. This will make a full copy of the data for the `Config` instance to
own, which does take more time and memory than storing a reference to the
string data. However, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward
since we don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references, so in this
circumstance giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile
trade-off.

<!-- This box is intended to go right after the paragraph talking about `clone`
/Carol -->

<!-- PROD: END BOX -->

We’ve updated `main` so that it places the instance of `Config` that
`parse_config` returns into a variable named `config`, and updated the code
that previously used the separate `query` and `filename` variables so that is
now uses the fields on the `Config` struct instead.

Our code now more clearly conveys our intent that `query` and `filename` are
related and their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code
that uses these values knows to find them in the `config` instance in the
fields named for their purpose.

#### Creating a Constructor for `Config`

<!-- Can you lay out what we intend to do in this section? I wasn't sure even
at the end what we did and why --- why did we create it as parse_config to then
change it to new? -->
<!-- We're making small, incremental changes. In addition to being good
software development practice, we were hoping that by changing one thing at a
time, the process of improving code's design would be easier to follow rather
than just jumping to the best solution. We extracted code into a function, then
it was clearer that we should introduce a struct, then it was clear that the
function we extracted is really a constructor of `Config` and should be written
as such. This refactoring process should be familiar to software developers.
I've tried to add a little recap to the start of this section, I hope that
helps. /Carol -->

So far, we’ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line
arguments from `main` into the `parse_config` function, which helped us to see
that the `query` and `filename` values were related and that relationship
should be conveyed in our code. We then added a `Config` struct to name the
related purpose of `query` and `filename`, and to be able to return the values’
names as struct field names from the `parse_config` function.

So now that the purpose of the `parse_config` function is to create a `Config`
instance, we can change `parse_config` from being a plain function into a
function named `new` that is associated with the `Config` struct. Making this
change will make our code more idiomatic: we can create instances of types in
the standard library like `String` by calling `String::new`, and by changing
`parse_config` to be a `new` function associated with `Config`, we’ll be able
to create instances of `Config` by calling `Config::new`. Listing 12-7 shows
the changes we’ll need to make:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args);

    // ...snip...
}

// ...snip...

impl Config {
    fn new(args: &[String]) -> Config {
        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        Config {
            query: query,
            filename: filename,
        }
    }
}
```

Listing 12-7: Changing `parse_config` into `Config::new`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

We’ve updated `main` where we were calling `parse_config` to instead call
`Config::new`. We’ve changed the name of `parse_config` to `new` and moved it
within an `impl` block, which makes the `new` function associated with
`Config`. Try compiling this again to make sure it works.

### Fixing the Error Handling

Now we’ll work on fixing our error handling. Recall that we mentioned
attempting to access the values in the `args` vector at index 1 or index 2 will
cause the program to panic if the vector contains fewer than 3 items. Try
running the program without any arguments; it will look like this:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs`
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 1
but the index is 1',  /stable-dist-rustc/build/src/libcollections/vec.rs:1307
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

`index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1` is an error message that
is intended for programmers, and won’t really help our end users understand
what happened and what they should do instead. Let’s fix that now.

#### Improving the Error Message

In Listing 12-8, we’re adding a check in the `new` function to check that the
slice is long enough before accessing index 1 and 2. If the slice isn’t long
enough, we panic with a better error message than the `index out of bounds`
message:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
// ...snip...
fn new(args: &[String]) -> Config {
    if args.len() < 3 {
        panic!("not enough arguments");
    }
    // ...snip...
```

Listing 12-8: Adding a check for the number of arguments

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

This is similar to the `Guess::new` function we wrote in Listing 9-8, where we
called `panic!` if the `value` argument was out of the range of valid values.
Instead of checking for a range of values, we’re checking that the length of
`args` is at least 3, and the rest of the function can operate under the
assumption that this condition has been met. If `args` has fewer than 3 items,
this condition will be true, and we call the `panic!` macro to end the program
immediately.

With these extra few lines of code in `new`, let’s try running our program
without any arguments again and see what the error looks like now:

```
$ cargo run
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs`
thread 'main' panicked at 'not enough arguments', src/main.rs:29
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

This output is better, we now have a reasonable error message. However, we also
have a bunch of extra information we don’t want to give to our users. So
perhaps using the technique we used in Listing 9-8 isn’t the best to use here;
a call to `panic!` is more appropriate for a programming problem rather than a
usage problem anyway, as we discussed in Chapter 9. Instead, we can use the
other technique we learned about in that chapter: returning a `Result` that can
indicate either success or an error.

<!-- Below -- how does using new fix this, can you lay that our up front? -->
<!-- I'm not sure what you mean, we're already using `new` and the fix continues
to use `new`... /Carol -->

#### Returning a `Result` from `new` Instead of Calling `panic!`

We can choose to instead return a `Result` value that will contain a `Config`
instance in the successful case, and will describe the problem in the error
case. When `Config::new` is communicating to `main`, we can use Rust’s way of
signaling that there was a problem using the `Result` type. Then we can change
`main` to convert an `Err` variant into a nicer error for our users, without
the surrounding text about `thread 'main'` and `RUST_BACKTRACE` that a call to
`panic!` causes.

Listing 12-9 shows the changes to the return value of `Config::new` and the
body of the function needed to return a `Result`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
impl Config {
    fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        Ok(Config {
            query: query,
            filename: filename,
        })
    }
}
```

Listing 12-9: Return a `Result` from `Config::new`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

<!-- what does returning a Result rather than a Config do? -->
<!-- This is what Chapter 9 was about, I've added a few more references
to that chapter to reinforce the connection /Carol -->

Our `new` function now returns a `Result`, with a `Config` instance in the
success case and a `&'static str` in the error case. Recall from “The Static
Lifetime” section in Chapter 10 that `&'static str` is the type of string
literals, which is our error message type for now.

We’ve made two changes in the body of the `new` function: instead of calling
`panic!` when the user doesn’t pass enough arguments, we now return an `Err`
value, and we’ve wrapped the `Config` return value in an `Ok`. These changes
make the function conform to its new type signature.

By having `Config::new` return an `Err` value, it allows the `main` function to
handle the `Result` value returned from the `new` function and exit the process
more cleanly in the error case.

#### Calling `Config::new` and Handling Errors

In order to handle the error case and print a user-friendly message, we need to
update `main` to handle the `Result` that `Config::new` is now returning as
shown in Listing 12-10. We’re also going to implement by hand something that
`panic!` handled for us: exiting the command line tool with an error code of 1.
A nonzero exit status is a convention to signal to the process that called our
program that our program ended with an error state.

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::process;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        println!("Problem parsing arguments: {}", err);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    // ...snip...
```

Listing 12-10: Exiting with an error code if creating a new `Config` fails

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

<!-- In the `main` function itself, we'll handle the `Result` value returned
from the `new` function and exit the process in a cleaner way if `Config::new`
returns an `Err` value.-->
<!-- I moved this line above to the previous section, it seems to at least
partially answer some of my earlier confusions, though I'm not following this
as well as I'd like so not sure if I have this right, can you confirm either
way whether that move makes sense? -->
<!-- That's fine /Carol -->

In this listing, we’re using a method we haven’t covered before:
`unwrap_or_else`, which is defined on `Result<T, E>` by the standard library.
Using `unwrap_or_else` allows us to define some custom, non-`panic!` error
handling. If the `Result` is an `Ok` value, this method’s behavior is similar
to `unwrap`: it returns the inner value `Ok` is wrapping. However, if the value
is an `Err` value, this method calls the code in the *closure*, which is an
anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to `unwrap_or_else`. We’ll
be covering closures in more detail in Chapter 13. What you need to know for
now is that `unwrap_or_else` will pass the inner value of the `Err`, which in
this case is the static string `not enough arguments` that we added in Listing
12-9, to our closure in the argument `err` that appears between the vertical
pipes. The code in the closure can then use the `err` value when it runs.

<!--Can you give a high-level idea of what the closure does with it? -->
<!-- Does with what? I've tried to elaborate in the above and below paragraphs,
but I'm not sure exactly what's confusing /Carol -->

We’ve added a new `use` line to import `process` from the standard library. The
code in the closure that will get run in the error case is only two lines: we
print out the `err` value, then call `std::process::exit` (we’ve added a new
`use` line at the top to import `process` from the standard library).
`process::exit` will stop the program immediately and return the number that
was passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the `panic!`-based
handling we used in Listing 12-8, with the exception that we no longer get all
the extra output. Let’s try it:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling greprs v0.1.0 (file:///projects/greprs)
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs`
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
```

Great! This output is much friendlier for our users.

### Extracting a `run` Function

Now we’re done refactoring our configuration parsing; let’s turn to our
program’s logic. As we laid out in the process we discussed in the “Separation
of Concerns for Binary Projects” section, we’re going to extract a function
named `run` that will hold all of the logic currently in the `main` function
that isn’t setting up configuration or handling errors. Once we’re done, `main`
will be concise and easy to verify by inspection, and we’ll be able to write
tests for all of the other logic.

<!-- it contains ALL the function from main? Can you say why we're doing this,
hw this improves it? What is the run function doing? I'm afraid I feel a bit in
the dark here-->
<!-- This is the pattern that we explained in the Separation of Concerns for
Binary Projects section. I've added a reference back to that and reiterated
some of the reasoning from there, but this section isn't introducing the
concept of the `run` function holding the logic that was in `main` /Carol -->

Listing 12-11 shows the extracted `run` function. For now, we’re making only
the small, incremental improvement of extracting the function and still
defining the function in *src/main.rs*:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    // ...snip...

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    run(config);
}

fn run(config: Config) {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename).expect("file not found");

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents).expect("something went wrong reading the file");

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);
}

// ...snip...
```

Listing 12-11: Extracting a `run` function containing the rest of the program
logic

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

The `run` function now contains all the remaining logic from `main` starting
from reading the file. The `run` function takes the `Config` instance as an
argument.

#### Returning Errors from the `run` Function

With the remaining program logic separated into the `run` function rather than
being in `main`, we can improve the error handling like we did with
`Config::new` in Listing 12-9. Instead of allowing the program to panic by
calling `expect`, the `run` function will return a `Result<T, E>` when
something goes wrong. This will let us further consolidate the logic around
handling errors in a user-friendly way into `main`. Listing 12-12 shows the
changes to the signature and body of `run`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
use std::error::Error;

// ...snip...

fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);

    Ok(())
}
```

Listing 12-12: Changing the `run` function to return `Result`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

We’ve made three big changes here. First, we’re changing the return type of the
`run` function to `Result<(), Box<Error>>`. This function previously returned
the unit type, `()`, and we keep that as the value returned in the `Ok` case.

<!-- is just the `Box` bit the trait object, or the whole `Box<Error>`
syntax?-->
<!-- The whole `Box<Error>` /Carol -->

For our error type, we’re using the *trait object* `Box<Error>` (and we’ve
brought `std::error::Error` into scope with a `use` statement at the top).
We’ll be covering trait objects in Chapter 17. For now, just know that
`Box<Error>` means the function will return a type that implements the `Error`
trait, but we don’t have to specify what particular type the return value will
be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that may be of different
types in different error cases.

The second change we’re making is removing the calls to `expect` in favor of
`?`, like we talked about in Chapter 9. Rather than `panic!` on an error, this
will return the error value from the current function for the caller to handle.

Thirdly, this function now returns an `Ok` value in the success case. We’ve
declared the `run` function’s success type as `()` in the signature, which
means we need to wrap the unit type value in the `Ok` value. This `Ok(())`
syntax may look a bit strange at first, but using `()` like this is the
idiomatic way to indicate that we’re calling `run` for its side effects only;
it doesn’t return a value we need.

When you run this, it will compile, but with a warning:

```
warning: unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default
  --> src/main.rs:39:5
   |
39 |     run(config);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Rust is telling us that our code ignores the `Result` value, which might be
indicating that there was an error. We’re not checking to see if there was an
error or not, though, and the compiler is reminding us that we probably meant
to have some error handling code here! Let’s rectify that now.

#### Handling Errors Returned from `run` in `main`

We’ll check for errors and handle them nicely using a similar technique to the
way we handled errors with `Config::new` in Listing 12-10, but with a slight
difference:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    // ...snip...

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    if let Err(e) = run(config) {
        println!("Application error: {}", e);

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

We use `if let` to check whether `run` returns an `Err` value, rather than
`unwrap_or_else`, and call `process::exit(1)` if it does. `run` doesn’t return
a value that we want to `unwrap` like `Config::new` returns the `Config`
instance. Because `run` returns a `()` in the success case, we only care about
detecting an error, so we don’t need `unwrap_or_else` to return the unwrapped
value as it would only be `()`.

The bodies of the `if let` and the `unwrap_or_else` functions are the same in
both cases though: we print out the error and exit.

### Split Code into a Library Crate

This is looking pretty good so far! Now we’re going to split the *src/main.rs*
file up and put some code into *src/lib.rs* so that we can test it and have a
small `main` function.

Let’s move the following pieces of code from *src/main.rs* to a new file,
*src/lib.rs*:

- The `run` function definition
- The relevant `use` statements
- The definition of `Config`
- The `Config::new` function definition

The contents of *src/lib.rs* should now look like Listing 12-13:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub filename: String,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        Ok(Config {
            query: query,
            filename: filename,
        })
    }
}

pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>>{
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    println!("With text:\n{}", contents);

    Ok(())
}
```

Listing 12-13: Moving `Config` and `run` into *src/lib.rs*

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

We’ve made liberal use of `pub` here: on `Config`, its fields and its `new`
method, and on the `run` function. We now have a library crate that has a
public API that we can test.

#### Calling the Library Crate from the Binary Crate

Now we need to bring the code we moved to *src/lib.rs* into the scope of the
binary crate in *src/main.rs* by using `extern crate greprs`. Then we’ll add a
`use greprs::Config` line to bring the `Config` type into scope, and prefix the
`run` function with our crate name as shown in Listing 12-14:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
extern crate greprs;

use std::env;
use std::process;

use greprs::Config;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    let config = Config::new(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        println!("Problem parsing arguments: {}", err);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    println!("Searching for {}", config.query);
    println!("In file {}", config.filename);

    if let Err(e) = greprs::run(config) {
        println!("Application error: {}", e);

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

Listing 12-14: Bringing the `greprs` crate into the scope of *src/main.rs*

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

With that, all the functionality should be connected and should work. Give it a
`cargo run` and make sure everything is wired up correctly.

<!-- any tips for if they do find something is broken, main places to check? Or
just "diff your file against the XXX file in the book's resources to check
where it went wrong"? -->
<!-- We think general troubleshooting tips should be something we cover in
Chapter 1; the tips should apply to any example in the book /Carol -->

Whew! That was a lot of work, but we’ve set ourselves up for success in the
future. Now it’s much easier to handle errors, and we’ve made our code more
modular. Almost all of our work will be done in *src/lib.rs* from here on out.

Let’s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would
have been hard with our old code, but is easy with our new code: write some
tests!

## Testing the Library’s Functionality

Now that we’ve extracted the logic into *src/lib.rs* and left all the argument
parsing and error handling in *src/main.rs*, it’s much easier for us to write
tests for the core functionality of our code. We can call our functions
directly with various arguments and check return values without having to call
our binary from the command line.

In this section, we’re going to follow the Test Driven Development (TDD)
process. This is a software development technique that follows this set of
steps:

1. Write a test that fails, and run it to make sure it fails for the reason
   you expected.
2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
3. Refactor the code you just added or changed, and make sure the tests
   continue to pass.
4. Repeat!

This is just one of many ways to write software, but TDD can help drive the
design of code. Writing the test before writing the code that makes the test
pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.

We’re going to test drive the implementation of the part of our `greprs`
program that will actually do the searching for the query string in the file
contents and produce a list of lines that match the query. We’re going to add
this functionality in a function called `search`.

### Writing a Failing Test

First, since we don’t really need them any more, let’s remove the `println!`
statements from both *src/lib.rs* and *src/main.rs*. Then we’ll add a `test`
module with a test function, like we did in Chapter 11. The test function
specifies the behavior we’d like the `search` function to have: it will take
a query and the text to search for the query in, and will return only the lines
from the text that contain the query. Listing 12-15 shows this test:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn one_result() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["safe, fast, productive."],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
```

Listing 12-15: Creating a failing test for the `search` function we wish we had

We’ve chosen to use “duct” as the string we’re looking for in this test. The
text we’re searching in is three lines, only one of which contains “duct”. We
assert that the value returned from the `search` function contains only the one
line we expect.

We aren’t able to run this test and watch it fail though, since this test
doesn’t even compile yet! We’re going to add just enough code to get it to
compile: a definition of the `search` function that always returns an empty
vector, as shown in Listing 12-16. Once we have this, the test should compile
and fail because an empty vector doesn’t match a vector containing the one
line `"safe, fast, productive."`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
     vec![]
}
```

Listing 12-16: Defining just enough of the `search` function that our test will
compile

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

Notice that we need an explicit lifetime `'a` defined in the signature of
`search` and used with the `contents` argument and the return value. Remember
from Chapter 10 that the lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime is
connected to the lifetime of the return value. In this case, we’re indicating
that the returned vector should contain string slices that reference slices of
the argument `contents` (rather than the argument `query`).

In other words, we’re telling Rust that the data returned by the `search`
function will live as long as the data passed into the `search` function in the
`contents` argument. This is important! The data referenced *by* a slice needs
to be valid in order for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumed we
were making string slices of `query` rather than `contents`, it would do its
safety checking incorrectly.

If we tried to compile this function without lifetimes, we would get this error:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/lib.rs:5:47
  |
5 | fn search(query: &str, contents: &str) -> Vec<&str> {
  |                                               ^ expected lifetime parameter
  |
  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the
  signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `query` or `contents`
```

Rust can’t possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell
it. Because `contents` is the argument that contains all of our text and we
want to return the parts of that text that match, we know `contents` is the
argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime syntax.

Other programming languages don’t require you to connect arguments to return
values in the signature, so this may still feel strange, but will get easier
over time. You may want to compare this example with the Lifetime Syntax
section in Chapter 10.

Now let’s try running our test:

```
$ cargo test
...warnings...
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/greprs-abcabcabc

running 1 test
test test::one_result ... FAILED

failures:

---- test::one_result stdout ----
	thread 'test::one_result' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
(left: `[“safe, fast, productive.“]`, right: `[]`)', src/lib.rs:16
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.


failures:
    test::one_result

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

error: test failed
```

Great, our test fails, exactly as we expected. Let’s get the test to pass!

### Writing Code that Gets the Test to Pass

Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector. To fix
that and implement `search`, our program needs to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each line of the contents.
2. Check if the line contains our query string.
   * If it does, add it to the list of values we’re returning.
   * If it doesn’t, do nothing.
3. Return the list of results that match.

Let’s take each step at a time, starting with iterating through lines.

#### Iterating Through Lines with the `lines` method

Rust has a helpful method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings,
conveniently named `lines`, that works as shown in Listing 12-17:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        // do something with line
    }
}
```

Listing 12-17: Iterating through each line in `contents`

<!-- Will add wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

The `lines` method returns an iterator. We’ll be talking about iterators in
depth in Chapter 13, but we’ve already seen this way of using an iterator in
Listing 3-6, where we used a `for` loop with an iterator to run some code on
each item in a collection.

<!-- so what does `lines` do on its own, if we need to use it in a for loop to
work? -->
<!-- It does nothing on its own, it returns an iterator for you to do something
with. Here, the thing we're doing with it is using it with a `for` loop. I'm
not sure exactly what you're asking or how to make the text clearer, but I
added a reference to where we've done this in the book previously. /Carol -->

#### Searching Each Line for the Query

Next, we’ll add functionality to check if the current line contains the query
string. Luckily, strings have another helpful method named `contains` that does
this for us! Add the `contains` method to the `search` function as shown in
Listing 12-18:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            // do something with line
        }
    }
}
```

Listing 12-18: Adding functionality to see if the line contains the string in
`query`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

#### Storing Matching Lines

Finally, we need a way to store the lines that contain our query string. For
that, we can make a mutable vector before the `for` loop and call the `push`
method to store a `line` in the vector. After the `for` loop, we return the
vector, as shown in Listing 12-19:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

Listing 12-19: Storing the lines that match so that we can return them

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

Now the `search` function should be returning only the lines that contain
`query`, and our test should pass. Let’s run the tests:

```
$ cargo test
running 1 test
test test::one_result ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

     Running target/debug/greprs-2f55ee8cd1721808

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests greprs

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Our test passed, great, it works!

Now that our test is passing, we could consider opportunities for refactoring
the implementation of the `search` function while keeping the tests passing in
order to maintain the same functionality while we do so. This code isn’t bad,
but it isn’t taking advantage of some useful features of iterators. We’ll be
coming back to this example in Chapter 13 where we’ll explore iterators in
detail and see how to improve it.

<!-- If we aren't going into this here, maybe just keep it focused, there's a
lot going on here as is -->
<!-- The reason we mention refactoring here is that it's a key step in the TDD
method that we were implicitly using before. Now that we've added text to the
beginning of this section to explicitly mention that we're doing TDD and what
the steps are, we want to address the "refactor" step. People who have some
experience with Rust might also look at this example and wonder why we're not
doing this in a different way, and be concerned that we're not teaching the
best way possible. This paragraph reassures them that we know what we're doing
and we're getting to the better way in Chapter 13. /Carol -->

#### Using the `search` Function in the `run` Function

Now that we have the `search` function working and tested, we need to actually
call `search` from our `run` function. We need to pass the `config.query` value
and the `contents` that `run` read from the file to the `search` function. Then
`run` will print out each line returned from `search`:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>> {
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    for line in search(&config.query, &contents) {
        println!("{}", line);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

We’re again using a `for` loop to get each line returned from `search`, and
the code that we run for each line prints it out.

Now our whole program should be working! Let’s try it out, first with a word
that should return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem, “frog”:

```
$ cargo run frog poem.txt
   Compiling greprs v0.1.0 (file:///projects/greprs)
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.38 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs frog poem.txt`
How public, like a frog
```

Cool! Next, how about a word that will match multiple lines, like “the”:

```
$ cargo run the poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs the poem.txt`
Then there's a pair of us — don't tell!
To tell your name the livelong day
```

And finally, let’s make sure that we don’t get any lines when we search for a
word that isn’t anywhere in the poem, like “monomorphization”:

```
$ cargo run monomorphization poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs monomorphization poem.txt`
```

Excellent! We’ve built our own version of a classic tool, and learned a lot
about how to structure applications. We’ve also learned a bit about file input
and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.

Feel free to move on to Chapter 13 if you’d like at this point. To round out
this project chapter, though, we’re going to briefly demonstrate how to work
with environment variables and printing to standard error, both of which are
useful when writing command line programs.

## Working with Environment Variables

We’re going to improve our tool with an extra feature: an option for case
insensitive searching turned on via an environment variable. We could make this
a command line option and require that users enter it each time they want it to
apply, but instead we’re going to use an environment variable. This allows our
users to set the environment variable once and have all their searches be case
insensitive in that terminal session.

### Writing a Failing Test for the Case-Insensitive `search` Function

First, let’s add a new function that we will call when the environment variable
is on.

<!-- You mean, to turn the environment variable on? I'm not sure what we're
doing here-->
<!-- No, I'm not sure how this is unclear. We're adding a new function. We will
call the new function when the user turns on the environment variable. Can you
elaborate on what part of the above statement leads to the conclusion that the
new function is going to turn the environment variable on? Can you suggest a
rewording that makes the causality direction clearer? /Carol -->

We’re going to continue following the TDD process that we started doing in the
last section, and the first step is again to write a failing test. We’ll add a
new test for the new case insensitive search function, and rename our old test
from `one_result` to `case_sensitive` to be clearer about the differences
between the two tests, as shown in Listing 12-20:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn case_sensitive() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Duct tape.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["safe, fast, productive."],
            search(query, contents)
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn case_insensitive() {
        let query = "rUsT";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.
Trust me.";

        assert_eq!(
            vec!["Rust:", "Trust me."],
            search_case_insensitive(query, contents)
        );
    }
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

Listing 12-20: Adding a new failing test for the case insensitive function
we’re about to add

Note that we’ve edited the old test’s `query` and `contents` too: we changed
the query to “duct”, which will match the line with the word “productive”.
We’ve added a new line with the text “Duct tape”, with a capital D, that
shouldn’t match the query “duct” when we’re searching for the query in a case
sensitive manner. We’ve changed this test to ensure that we don’t accidentally
break the case sensitive search functionality that we’ve already implemented;
this test should pass now and should continue to pass as we work on the case
insensitive search.

The new test for the case insensitive search uses “rUsT” with some capital
letters as its query. The expected return value from the
`search_case_insensitive` function we’re going to add is that the query “rust”
will match both the line containing “Rust:“ with a capital R and also the line
“Trust me.“ that contains “rust” with a lowercase r. This test will fail to
compile right now since we haven’t yet defined the `search_case_insensitive`
function; feel free to add a skeleton implementation that always returns an
empty array in the same way that we did for the `search` function in Listing
12-16 in order to see the test compile and fail.

### Implementing the `search_case_insensitive` Function

The `search_case_insensitive` function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost
the same as the `search` function. The difference is that we’ll lowercase the
`query` function and each `line` so that whatever the case of the input
arguments, they will be the same case when we check whether the line contains
the query.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
fn search_case_insensitive<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let query = query.to_lowercase();
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.to_lowercase().contains(&query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

Listing 12-21: Defining the `search_case_insensitive` function to lowercase
both the query and the line before comparing them

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

<!-- why do we lowercase the search string? and why does it need to be a string
rather than a slice? -->
<!-- We explained this above, that in order to make the search case
insensitive, we need to lowercase everything so that searches will always match
no matter what case either the query or each line uses. It needs to be a
`String` because we're creating new data, not referencing existing data, when
we call `to_lowercase`. I've tried to make both of these points clearer, but
I'm not sure exactly what was unclear about it before, so I'm not sure if I've
helped. /Carol -->

First, we lowercase the `query` string, and store it in a shadowed variable
with the same name. Calling `to_lowercase` on the query is necessary so that no
matter if the user’s query is “rust”, “RUST”, “Rust”, or “rUsT”, we’ll treat
the query as if it was “rust” and be insensitive to the case.

Note that `query` is now a `String` rather than a string slice, because calling
`to_lowercase` is creating new data, not referencing existing data. If the
query is “rUsT”, that string slice does not contain a lowercase u or t for us
to use, so we have to allocate a new `String` containing “rust”. Because
`query` is now a `String`, when we pass `query` as an argument to the
`contains` method, we need to add an ampersand since the signature of
`contains` is defined to take a string slice.

Next, we add a call to `to_lowercase` on each `line` before we check if it
contains `query`. This will turn “Rust:“ into “rust:“ and “Trust me.“ into
“trust me.“ Now that we’ve converted both `line` and `query` to all lowercase,
we’ll find matches no matter what case the text in the file has or the user
entered in the query.

Let’s see if this implementation passes the tests:

```
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/greprs-e58e9b12d35dc861

running 2 tests
test test::case_insensitive ... ok
test test::case_sensitive ... ok

test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

     Running target/debug/greprs-8a7faa2662b5030a

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured

   Doc-tests greprs

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

Great! Now, let’s actually call the new `search_case_insensitive` function from
the `run` function. First, we’re going to add a configuration option for
switching between case sensitive and case insensitive search to the `Config`
struct:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub struct Config {
    pub query: String,
    pub filename: String,
    pub case_sensitive: bool,
}
```

<!-- Will add ghosting in libreoffice /Carol -->

We add the `case_sensitive` field that holds a boolean. Then we need our `run`
function to check the `case_sensitive` field’s value and use that to decide
whether to call the `search` function or the `search_case_insensitive` function
as shown in Listing 12-22:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<Error>>{
    let mut f = File::open(config.filename)?;

    let mut contents = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;

    let results = if config.case_sensitive {
        search(&config.query, &contents)
    } else {
        search_case_insensitive(&config.query, &contents)
    };

    for line in results {
        println!("{}", line);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Listing 12-22: Calling either `search` or `search_case_insensitive` based on
the value in `config.case_sensitive`

<!-- Will add ghosting in libreoffice /Carol -->

Finally, we need to actually check for the environment variable. The functions
for working with environment variables are in the `env` module in the standard
library, so we want to bring that module into scope with a `use std::env;`
line at the top of *src/lib.rs*. Then we’re going to use the `var` method
from the `env` module in `Config::new` to check for an environment variable
named `CASE_INSENSITIVE`, as shown in Listing 12-23:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```
use std::env;

// ...snip...

impl Config {
    pub fn new(args: &[String]) -> Result<Config, &'static str> {
        if args.len() < 3 {
            return Err("not enough arguments");
        }

        let query = args[1].clone();
        let filename = args[2].clone();

        let case_sensitive = env::var("CASE_INSENSITIVE").is_err();

        Ok(Config {
            query: query,
            filename: filename,
            case_sensitive: case_sensitive,
        })
    }
}
```

Listing 12-23: Checking for an environment variable named `CASE_INSENSITIVE`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

Here, we create a new variable `case_sensitive`. In order to set its value, we
call the `env::var` function and pass it the name of the environment variable
we’re looking for, `CASE_INSENSITIVE`. `env::var` returns a `Result` that will
be the `Ok` variant containing the value if the environment variable is set,
and will be the `Err` variant if the environment variable is not set. We’re
using the `is_err` method on the `Result` to check to see if it’s an error (and
therefore unset), which means we *should* do a case sensitive search. If the
`CASE_INSENSITIVE` environment variable is set to anything, `is_err` will
return false and we will do a case insensitive search. We don’t care about the
value that the environment variable is set to, just whether it’s set or unset,
so we’re checking `is_err` rather than `unwrap`, `expect`, or any of the other
methods we’ve seen on `Result`. We pass the value in the `case_sensitive`
variable to the `Config` instance so that the `run` function can read that
value and decide whether to call `search` or `search_case_insensitive` as we
implemented in Listing 12-22.

Let’s give it a try! First, we’ll run our program without the environment
variable set and with the query “to”, which should match any line that contains
the word “to” in all lowercase:

```
$ cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
```

Looks like that still works! Now, let’s run the program with `CASE_INSENSITIVE`
set to 1 but with the same query “to”, and we should get lines that contain
“to” that might have capital letters:

```
$ CASE_INSENSITIVE=1 cargo run to poem.txt
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/greprs to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

Excellent, we also got lines containing “To”! Our `greprs` program can now do
case insensitive searching, controlled by an environment variable. Now you know
how to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment
variables!

Some programs allow both arguments *and* environment variables for the same
configuration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes
precedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case
insensitivity through a command line argument as well as through the
environment variable, and decide which should take precedence the program is
run with contradictory values.

The `std::env` module contains many more useful features for dealing with
environment variables; check out its documentation to see what’s available.

## Write to `stderr` Instead of `stdout`

Right now, we’re writing all of our output to the terminal with `println!`.
Most terminals provide two kinds of output: “standard out” for general
information, and “standard error” for error messages. This distinction is the
behavior that’s expected of command line programs: it enables users to choose
to direct a program’s successful output to a file but still print error
messages to the screen, for example. `println!` is only capable of printing to
standard out, though, so we have to use something else in order to print to
standard error.

We can verify that, the way we’ve written `greprs` so far, everything is being
written to standard out, including error messages that should be written to
standard error instead. We’ll do that by intentionally causing an error, the
one that happens when we run the program without any arguments. We’re going to
redirect standard output to a file, but not standard error. The way command
line programs are expected to work is that, because the output is an error
message, it should be shown on the screen rather than being redirected to the
file. Let’s see that our program is not currently meeting this expectation by
using `>` and specifying a filename, *output.txt*, that we want to redirect
standard out to:

```
$ cargo run > output.txt
```

<!-- why do we get an error here? Was that intentional? Does that mean it can't
print stdout to a file? -->
<!-- Yes, we're intentionally causing an error here to show that errors are
currently going to the wrong place. It's showing that `println!` only prints
to standard out, even when we're printing error messages that should go
to standard error. /Carol-->

The `>` syntax tells the shell to write the contents of standard out to
*output.txt* instead of the screen. We didn’t see the error message we were
expecting printed on the screen, so that means it must have ended up in the
file. Let’s see what *output.txt* contains:

```
Application error: No search string or filename found
```

<!-- I don't understand why we send this output to a file to then just say we
want it to the screen, won't it do that by default? And what has this got to do
with our use of println? I'm finding the motives here hard to follow -->
<!-- The point of showing this is to demonstrate that our program is NOT doing
the correct thing by default, we need to change the places we're calling
`println!` with error messages to print to standard error instead. When to use
stdout vs. stderr, and why you might want to redirect stdout but not stderr,
is something our readers will be familiar with. /Carol -->

Yup, there’s our error message, which means it’s being printed to standard out.
This isn’t what’s expected from command line programs. It’s much more useful
for error messages like this to be printed to standard error, and only have
data printed to standard out from a successful run end up in the file when we
redirect standard out in this way. Let’s change how error messages are printed
as shown in Listing 12-23. Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this
chapter, all of the code that prints error messages is in one place, in `main`:

Filename: src/main.rs

```
extern crate greprs;

use std::env;
use std::process;
use std::io::prelude::*;

use greprs::Config;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let mut stderr = std::io::stderr();

    let config = Config::new(&args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        writeln!(
            &mut stderr,
            "Problem parsing arguments: {}",
            err
        ).expect("Could not write to stderr");
        process::exit(1);
    });

    if let Err(e) = greprs::run(config) {
        writeln!(
            &mut stderr,
            "Application error: {}",
            e
        ).expect("Could not write to stderr");

        process::exit(1);
    }
}
```

Listing 12-23: Writing error messages to `stderr` instead of `stdout` using
`writeln!`

<!-- Will add ghosting and wingdings in libreoffice /Carol -->

Rust does not have a convenient function like `println!` for writing to
standard error. Instead, we use the `writeln!` macro, which is like `println!`
but takes an extra argument. The first thing we pass to it is what to write to.
We can acquire a handle to standard error through the `std::io::stderr`
function. We give a mutable reference to `stderr` to `writeln!`; we need it to
be mutable so we can write to it! The second and third arguments to `writeln!`
are like the first and second arguments to `println!`: a format string and any
variables we’re interpolating.

Let’s try running the program again in the same way, without any arguments and
redirecting `stdout` with `>`:

```
$ cargo run > output.txt
Application error: No search string or filename found
```

Now we see our error on the screen, and `output.txt` contains nothing, which is
the behavior that’s expected of command line programs.

If we run the program again with arguments that don’t cause an error, but still
redirecting standard out to a file:

```
$ cargo run to poem.txt > output.txt
```

We won’t see any output to our terminal, and `output.txt` will contain our
results:

Filename: output.txt

```
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
```

This demonstrates that we’re now using standard out for successful output and
standard error for error output as appropriate.

## Summary

In this chapter, we’ve recapped on some of the major concepts so far and
covered how to do common I/O operations in a Rust context. By using command
line arguments, files, environment variables, and the `writeln!` macro with
`stderr`, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. By using the
concepts from previous chapters, your code will be well-organized, be able to
store data effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors
nicely, and be well tested.

Next, let’s explore some functional-language influenced Rust features: closures
and iterators.
