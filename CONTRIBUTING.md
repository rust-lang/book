# Contributing

We’re currently working with No Starch Press to bring the book to print. Each
chapter goes through [a number of stages][project]:

[project]: https://github.com/rust-lang/book/projects/1

* We write and edit a chapter’s initial content
* No Starch provides a round of edits and questions
* We revise, clarify, and check those edits
* A Technical Reviewer checks for the accuracy of technical details
* No Starch copyedits the chapter for spelling, grammar, wording, consistency
* We revise, clarify, and check the copyedits
* The chapter goes to layout, at which point only minor changes should be made

We would love issues and pull requests to the Markdown files in the src
directory, up until the chapter goes to layout with No Starch. At that point,
we will likely only be accepting changes that correct factual errors or major
problems and not, for example, minor wording changes.

The chapters we have planned but that we have not yet written appear greyed out
in the sidebar of the rendered book. We would love issues with ideas for what,
specifically, you’d like to see covered in those planned chapters!

Our [open pull requests][pulls] are new chapters or edits that we’re currently
working on. We would love if you would read through those and make comments for
any suggestions or corrections!

If you’re looking for ways to help that don’t involve reading or writing, check
out the [open issues with the E-help-wanted label][help-wanted]. These might be
Rust code, frontend code, or shell scripts that would help us be more efficient
or enhance the book in some way!
