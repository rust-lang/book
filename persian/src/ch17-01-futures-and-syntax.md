## Futures and the Async Syntax

The key elements of asynchronous programming in Rust are _futures_ and Rust’s
`async` and `await` keywords.

A _future_ is a value which may not be ready now, but will become ready at some
point in the future. (This same concept shows up in many languages, sometimes
under other names such as “task” or “promise”.) Rust provides a `Future` trait
as a building block so different async operations can be implemented with
different data structures, but with a common interface. In Rust, we say that
types which implement the `Future` trait are futures. Each type which
implements `Future` holds its own information about the progress that has been
made and what "ready" means.

The `async` keyword can be applied to blocks and functions to specify that they
can be interrupted and resumed. Within an async block or async function, you can
use the `await` keyword to wait for a future to become ready, called _awaiting a
future_. Each place you await a future within an async block or function is a
place that async block or function may get paused and resumed. The process of
checking with a future to see if its value is available yet is called _polling_.

Some other languages also use `async` and `await` keywords for async
programming. If you’re familiar with those languages, you may notice some
significant differences in how Rust does things, including how it handles the
syntax. That’s for good reason, as we’ll see!

Most of the time when writing async Rust, we use the `async` and `await`
keywords. Rust compiles them into equivalent code using the `Future` trait, much
as it compiles `for` loops into equivalent code using the `Iterator` trait.
Because Rust provides the `Future` trait, though, you can also implement it for
your own data types when you need to. Many of the functions we’ll see
throughout this chapter return types with their own implementations of `Future`.
We’ll return to the definition of the trait at the end of the chapter and dig
into more of how it works, but this is enough detail to keep us moving forward.

That may all feel a bit abstract. Let’s write our first async program: a little
web scraper. We’ll pass in two URLs from the command line, fetch both of them
concurrently, and return the result of whichever one finishes first. This
example will have a fair bit of new syntax, but don’t worry. We’ll explain
everything you need to know as we go.

### Our First Async Program

To keep this chapter focused on learning async, rather than juggling parts of
the ecosystem, we have created the `trpl` crate (`trpl` is short for “The Rust
Programming Language”). It re-exports all the types, traits, and functions
you’ll need, primarily from the [`futures`][futures-crate]<!-- ignore --> and
[`tokio`][tokio]<!-- ignore --> crates.

- The `futures` crate is an official home for Rust experimentation for async
  code, and is actually where the `Future` type was originally designed.

- Tokio is the most widely used async runtime in Rust today, especially (but
  not only!) for web applications. There are other great runtimes out there,
  and they may be more suitable for your purposes. We use Tokio under the hood
  for `trpl` because it’s well-tested and widely used.

In some cases, `trpl` also renames or wraps the original APIs to let us stay
focused on the details relevant to this chapter. If you want to understand what
the crate does, we encourage you to check out [its source
code][crate-source]<!-- ignore -->. You’ll be able to see what crate each
re-export comes from, and we’ve left extensive comments explaining what the
crate does.

Create a new binary project named `hello-async` and add the `trpl` crate as a
dependency:

```console
$ cargo new hello-async
$ cd hello-async
$ cargo add trpl
```

Now we can use the various pieces provided by `trpl` to write our first async
program. We’ll build a little command line tool which fetches two web pages,
pulls the `<title>` element from each, and prints out the title of whichever
finishes that whole process first.

Let’s start by writing a function that takes one page URL as a parameter, makes
a request to it, and returns the text of the title element:

<Listing number="17-1" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Defining an async function to get the title element from an HTML page">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-01/src/main.rs:all}}
```

</Listing>

In Listing 17-1, we define a function named `page_title`, and we mark it with
the `async` keyword. Then we use the `trpl::get` function to fetch whatever URL
is passed in, and we await the response by using the `await` keyword. Then we
get the text of the response by calling its `text` method, and once again await
it with the `await` keyword. Both of these steps are asynchronous. For `get`,
we need to wait for the server to send back the first part of its response,
which will include HTTP headers, cookies, and so on. That part of the response
can be delivered separately from the body of the request. Especially if the
body is very large, it can take some time for it all to arrive. Thus, we have
to wait for the _entirety_ of the response to arrive, so the `text` method is
also async.

We have to explicitly await both of these futures, because futures in Rust are
_lazy_: they don’t do anything until you ask them to with `await`. (In fact,
Rust will show a compiler warning if you don’t use a future.) This should
remind you of our discussion of iterators [back in Chapter 13][iterators-lazy]<!--
ignore -->.
Iterators do nothing unless you call their `next` method—whether directly, or
using `for` loops or methods such as `map` which use `next` under the hood. With
futures, the same basic idea applies: they do nothing unless you explicitly ask
them to. This laziness allows Rust to avoid running async code until it’s
actually needed.

> the previous chapter, where the closure we passed to another thread started

Once we have `response_text`, we can then parse it into an instance of the
`Html` type using `Html::parse`. Instead of a raw string, we now have a data
type we can use to work with the HTML as a richer data structure. In particular,
we can use the `select_first` method to find the first instance of a given CSS
selector. By passing the string `"title"`, we’ll get the first `<title>`
element in the document, if there is one. Because there may not be any matching
element, `select_first` returns an `Option<ElementRef>`. Finally, we use the
`Option::map` method, which lets us work with the item in the `Option` if it’s
present, and do nothing if it isn’t. (We could also use a `match` expression
here, but `map` is more idiomatic.) In the body of the function we supply to
`map`, we call `inner_html` on the `title_element` to get its content, which is
a `String`. When all is said and done, we have an `Option<String>`.

Notice that Rust’s `await` keyword goes after the expression you’re awaiting,
not before it. That is, it’s a _postfix keyword_. This may be different from
what you might be used to if you have used async in other languages. Rust chose
this because it makes chains of methods much nicer to work with. As a result, we
can change the body of `page_url_for` to chain the `trpl::get` and `text`
function calls together with `await` between them, as shown in Listing 17-2:

<Listing number="17-2" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Chaining with the `await` keyword">

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-02/src/main.rs:chaining}}
```

</Listing>

With that, we have successfully written our first async function! Before we add
some code in `main` to call it, let’s talk a little more about what we’ve
written and what it means.

When Rust sees a block marked with the `async` keyword, it compiles it into a
unique, anonymous data type which implements the `Future` trait. When Rust sees
a function marked with `async`, it compiles it into a non-async function whose
body is an async block. An async function’s return type is the type of the
anonymous data type the compiler creates for that async block.

Thus, writing `async fn` is equivalent to writing a function which returns a
_future_ of the return type. When the compiler sees a function definition such
as the `async fn page_title` in Listing 17-1, it’s equivalent to a non-async
function defined like this:

```rust
# extern crate trpl; // required for mdbook test
use std::future::Future;
use trpl::Html;

fn page_title(url: &str) -> impl Future<Output = Option<String>> + '_ {
    async move {
        let text = trpl::get(url).await.text().await;
        Html::parse(&text)
            .select_first("title")
            .map(|title| title.inner_html())
    }
}
```

Let’s walk through each part of the transformed version:

- It uses the `impl Trait` syntax we discussed back in the [“Traits as
  Parameters”][impl-trait]<!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 10.
- The returned trait is a `Future`, with an associated type of `Output`. Notice
  that the `Output` type is `Option<String>`, which is the same as the the
  original return type from the `async fn` version of `page_title`.
- All of the code called in the body of the original function is wrapped in an
  `async move` block. Remember that blocks are expressions. This whole block is
  the expression returned from the function.
- This async block produces a value with the type `Option<String>`, as described
  above. That value matches the `Output` type in the return type. This is just
  like other blocks you have seen.
- The new function body is an `async move` block because of how it uses the
  `url` parameter. (We’ll talk about `async` vs. `async move` much more later
  in the chapter.)
- The new version of the function has a kind of lifetime we haven’t seen before
  in the output type: `'_`. Because the function returns a `Future` which refers
  to a reference—in this case, the reference from the `url` parameter—we need to
  tell Rust that we mean for that reference to be included. We don’t have to
  name the lifetime here, because Rust is smart enough to know there is only one
  reference which could be involved, but we _do_ have to be explicit that the
  resulting `Future` is bound by that lifetime.

Now we can call `page_title` in `main`. To start, we’ll just get the title
for a single page. In Listing 17-3, we follow the same pattern we used for
getting command line arguments back in Chapter 12. Then we pass the first URL
`page_title`, and await the result. Because the value produced by the future is
an `Option<String>`, we use a `match` expression to print different messages to
account for whether the page had a `<title>`.

<Listing number="17-3" file-name="src/main.rs" caption="Calling the `page_title` function from `main` with a user-supplied argument">

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-03/src/main.rs:main}}
```

</Listing>

Unfortunately, this doesn’t compile. The only place we can use the `await`
keyword is in async functions or blocks, and Rust won’t let us mark the
special `main` function as `async`.

 --> src/main.rs:6:1
  |
6 | async fn main() {
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `main` function is not allowed to be `async`
```

The reason `main` can’t be marked `async` is that async code needs a _runtime_:
a Rust crate which manages the details of executing asynchronous code. A
program’s `main` function can _initialize_ a runtime, but it’s not a runtime
_itself_. (We’ll see more about why this is a bit later.) Every Rust program
that executes async code has at least one place where it sets up a runtime and
executes the futures.

Most languages which support async bundle a runtime with the language. Rust does
not. Instead, there are many different async runtimes available, each of which
makes different tradeoffs suitable to the use case they target. For example, a
high-throughput web server with many CPU cores and a large amount of RAM has
very different needs than a microcontroller with a single core, a small amount
of RAM, and no ability to do heap allocations. The crates which provide those
runtimes also often supply async versions of common functionality such as file
or network I/O.

Here, and throughout the rest of this chapter, we’ll use the `run` function
from the `trpl` crate, which takes a future as an argument and runs it to
completion. Behind the scenes, calling `run` sets up a runtime to use to run the
future passed in. Once the future completes, `run` returns whatever value the
future produced.

We could pass the future returned by `page_title` directly to `run`. Once it
completed, we would be able to match on the resulting `Option<String>`, the way
we tried to do in Listing 17-3. However, for most of the examples in the chapter
(and most async code in the real world!), we’ll be doing more than just one
async function call, so instead we’ll pass an `async` block and explicitly
await the result of calling `page_title`, as in Listing 17-4.

When we run this, we get the behavior we might have expected initially:

Phew: we finally have some working async code! This now compiles, and we can run
it. Before we add code to race two sites against each other, let’s briefly turn
our attention back to how futures work.

Each _await point_—that is, every place where the code uses the `await`
keyword—represents a place where control gets handed back to the runtime. To
make that work, Rust needs to keep track of the state involved in the async
block, so that the runtime can kick off some other work and then come back when
it’s ready to try advancing this one again. This is an invisible state machine,
as if you wrote an enum in this way to save the current state at each `await`
point:

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/no-listing-state-machine/src/lib.rs:enum}}
```

Writing the code to transition between each state by hand would be tedious and
error-prone, especially when adding more functionality and more states to the
code later. Instead, the Rust compiler creates and manages the state machine
data structures for async code automatically. If you’re wondering: yep, the
normal borrowing and ownership rules around data structures all apply. Happily,
the compiler also handles checking those for us, and has good error messages.
We’ll work through a few of those later in the chapter!

Ultimately, something has to execute that state machine. That something is a
runtime. (This is why you may sometimes come across references to _executors_
when looking into runtimes: an executor is the part of a runtime responsible for
executing the async code.)

Now we can understand why the compiler stopped us from making `main` itself an
async function back in Listing 17-3. If `main` were an async function, something
else would need to manage the state machine for whatever future `main` returned,
but `main` is the starting point for the program! Instead, we call the
`trpl::run` function in `main`, which sets up a runtime and runs the future
returned by the `async` block until it returns `Ready`.

Let’s put these pieces together and see how we can write concurrent code, by
calling `page_title` with two different URLs passed in from the command line
and racing them.

<Listing number="17-5" caption="" file-name="src/main.rs">

<!-- should_panic,noplayground because mdbook does not pass args -->

```rust,should_panic,noplayground
{{#rustdoc_include ../listings/ch17-async-await/listing-17-05/src/main.rs:all}}
```

</Listing>

In Listing 17-5, we begin by calling `page_title` for each of the user-supplied
URLs. We save the futures produced by calling `page_title` as `title_fut_1` and
`title_fut_2`. Remember, these don’t do anything yet, because futures are lazy,
and we haven’t yet awaited them. Then we pass the futures to `trpl::race`,
which returns a value to indicate which of the futures passed to it finishes
first.

> Note: Under the hood, `race` is built on a more general function, `select`,
> which you will encounter more often in real-world Rust code. A `select`
> function can do a lot of things that `trpl::race` function can’t, but it also
> has some additional complexity that we can skip over for now.

Either future can legitimately “win,” so it doesn’t make sense to return a
`Result`. Instead, `race` returns a type we haven’t seen before,
`trpl::Either`. The `Either` type is somewhat similar to a `Result`, in that it
has two cases. Unlike `Result`, though, there is no notion of success or
failure baked into `Either`. Instead, it uses `Left` and `Right` to indicate
“one or the other”.

```rust
enum Either<A, B> {
    Left(A),
    Right(B),
}
```

The `race` function returns `Left` if the first argument finishes first, with
that future’s output, and `Right` with the second future argument’s output if
_that_ one finishes first. This matches the order the arguments appear when
calling the function: the first argument is to the left of the second argument.

We also update `page_title` to return the same URL passed in. That way, if
the page which returns first does not have a `<title>` we can resolve, we can
still print a meaningful message. With that information available, we wrap up by
updating our `println!` output to indicate both which URL finished first and
what the `<title>` was for the web page at that URL, if any.

You have built a small working web scraper now! Pick a couple URLs and run the
command line tool. You may discover that some sites are reliably faster than
others, while in other cases which site “wins” varies from run to run. More
importantly, you’ve learned the basics of working with futures, so we can now
dig into even more of the things we can do with async.
