% Casting between types

<small>There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.</small>

> A type cast expression is denoted with the binary operator `as`.
> Executing an `as` expression casts the value on the left-hand side to the type on the right-hand side.

```rust
# fn sum(values: &[f64]) -> f64 { 0.0 }
# fn len(values: &[f64]) -> i32 { 0 }

fn average(values: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    let sum: f64 = sum(values);
    let size: f64 = len(values) as f64;
    sum / size
}
```
