% The Stack and the Heap

<small>There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.</small>

> Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that is available to your code to use at runtime, but they are structured in different ways.
> The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order.
> All data on the stack must take up a known, fixed size.
> For data with a size unknown to us at compile time or a size that might change, we can store data on the heap instead.
