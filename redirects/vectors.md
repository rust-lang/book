% Vectors

<small>There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.</small>

> Vectors store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory.
> Vectors can only store values of the same type.

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
```
