> Rust cannot prevent a trait from having a method with the same name as another traitâ€™s method, nor can it prevent us from implementing both of these traits on one type.
> In order to be able to call each of the methods with the same name, then, we need to tell Rust which one we want to use.

```rust
trait Pilot {
    fn fly(&self);
}

trait Wizard {
    fn fly(&self);
}

struct Human;

impl Pilot for Human {
#     fn fly(&self) {
#         println!("This is your captain speaking.");
#     }
}

impl Wizard for Human {
#     fn fly(&self) {
#         println!("Up!");
#     }
}

impl Human {
#     fn fly(&self) {
#         println!("*waving arms furiously*");
#     }
}

fn main() {
    let person = Human;
    Pilot::fly(&person);
    Wizard::fly(&person);
    person.fly();
}
```
