% if let

<small>There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.</small>

> The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern and ignore the rest.

```rust
let some_u8_value = Some(3u8);
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
    println!("three");
}
```
