% Primitive Types

<small>There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.</small>

> Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.
> The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
> In cases when many types are possible, a _type annotation_ must be added.

```rust
let x = 2.0; // f64

let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
```
