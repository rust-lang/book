<small>There is a new edition of the book and this is an old link.</small>

> A _struct_ is a custom data type that lets us name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}
```
